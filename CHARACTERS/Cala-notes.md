# Calabaza De Peligro Ratto Aka."Cala"

## PC Notes

Male, Fairy, Rogue, Arcane Trickster: 

It was a foggy moonlit dream of a night when the chanced encounter produced Calabaza. A roaming Ratkin (Cala's father from Brokenstone Vale) was bedazzled by the rusted glitter of dried blood on the wings of a flesh-eating Fey, while the Fey appreciated the sizable teeth and claws on the Ratkin. The gods chanced to look away for the evening's events and thus Cala came into being.

A mercurial creature, Calabaza De Peligro  was raised in a dual custody situation. His mother being a member of the Autumn Fey court, he was with his Fey relatives for fall/winter and his Ratkin relatives during spring/summer. Cala is usually two feet tall with grey fur and small bug-like wings that he hides. While he typically adopts more of the look of his Ratkin heritage in public, when exposed to Fey magic he tends to morph more Fey in appearance, dropping the innate glamor that keeps him as ratty as possible.

The preference for keeping his appearance more like his Ratkin side comes from experiences where Fey were mistrusted and disliked for simply existing. He also spent a significant amount of time in full rat form as the familiar of a captive goblin wizard. Indentured to the goblin through the machinations of her owner, a miserable elven archmage, he was known only as Pumpkin then. When a crafty halfling caused him to accidentally care about someone other than himself, the spell was dismantled, returning Pumpkin to his former Calabaza self.

Cala fled the wizard's home, where he'd been deeply loved and unwittingly enslaved all the same. After being rescued from extreme mana sickness by the greatest paladin of the land, he found himself knocking about the City of Lights with just his wits and his bare paws. His memory is patchy and he tends not to dwell on it anymore, assuming it will come back when it cares to. What is memory after all, but the ghost of an experience coming back to haunt you?

The liminal space of shadows and secret places are where the Cala feels most at home. Predisposed to making nests, ferreting out goods that "seem" abandoned, and chewing on leather goods, Cala finds trouble more often than not. Having inherited none of his father's strength and little of his mother's smarts, the Ratkin-Fey relied on a stealthy approach and a limber lightning-like ability to dip and dodge to make his escape. His nose and ears work to keep him safe, relying on rodent cunning and a gregarious disposition to get him through most social situations.

Cala avoids Saba at all costs. Too much emotional turmoil and such. Cala loved her, didn't like being pressganged to Saba as a familiar by her ex husband Victor.

### Cala's Song
    🎶
    People are strange,
    When you're a Ratkin,
    Fey look down on 
    you all alone

    Different seems wicked
    When you're unwanted
    Claws reach undaunted
    When you're a rat (+2 CON)

    … When you're strange
    Fey folk seek to deal pain. (+4 DEX)
    When you're strange
    No one remembers your name (+2 CHA)
    When you're strange….
    When you're straa-aaange…🎶

### DM to PC: Where do you think your character's head and heart are at after everything that’s happened so far?
    Cala is heartbroken that the hostages died and mad as hell that the hag Mother Snæbjörg' got him, costing his friends energy, time and life. It's vendetta time, and this is the most serious he's ever been.

### DM to PC: Is there anything you’d love to explore more deeply this time around - with your character, the world, the story?
    He's always been a bit of a Peter Pan, an irresponsible feral thing. I'm open to exploring him as a more serious character however. Ratkins tend to be considered were-creatures (at least in White Wolf), so maybe some moon based shenanigans?

- He does not remember much of his past but knows he was trapped in animus state (full rat) for 4 years as a wizard's familiar (Saba's).
- He ran into **Mother Snæbjörg**, a bheur hag who reveals she was behind Cala's kidnapping and has memories stored in dolls. (Darias has such a doll)
- He was frozen solid by Snæbjörg but saved by a ritual involving **Shrina the Compassionate One** and the Eternal Flame.

### Backstory

Father, Bramble Mossrunner, was a ratkin lycan and a guide who helped folks with safe passage across the Brokenstone Vale.
Mother was a fey fairy of the autumn court.
Once passed adolescence Cala bartered with civilized lycans on the outskirts of the Brokenstone Vale in feywild.  (Guide origin)
Evil lycans never liked that his father was mingling with the fey and something triggered them to take action… 
The last thing Cala clearly remembers from the feywild was a punch to the gut and a bag thrown over his head.
Cala was captured and sent to Fomorians in Harrowhame as a slaved
His parents tried their best to find him, but it was impossible. They felt terrible about it.
Deemed too small and useless as a slave, he was transferred to Mug Tureah as a potential test subject for many planar portals in the tunnels
Cala managed to escape and make it to NLP via the Underdark
Does not turn into a wererat currently but may do so after experiencing a full moon in the feywild.

He's a lycan-fey hybrid that struggles with animal instinct powered by Fey capability. Isn't particularly accepted by either side of his heritage.

He's the result of a "poor decisions" evening between a Fey and a Ratkin. He has the potential to shapeshift into a full ROUS rat (Lupus form) with the moon but has never experienced it due to being part Fey. He is usually in what passes for Crinos form for his species (the animal/hominid hybrid of rat with humanoid body)

He is not particularly attached to people, more interested in mischief than making solid connections, deceitful, thief-y, addicted to sugary things (coffee/alcohol consumption produces erratic behavior.)

He was trapped in animus state (full rat) for 4 years as a wizard's familiar (Saba's), until his self-awareness was re-awakened by the pettiest of emotions. He still has large gaps in his memory of who he used to be before becoming Pumpkin, Saba's rat.

Victor is/was Saba's ex-husband. A necromancy-using elf wizard who crafted the spellbook she now uses out of back-skin pages from murdered folks, many his own wives and children.

Cala was a derpy thief who tried to steal.Cala tried to steal something from Victor and got caught in the act It happened in Ansalon (Dragonlance continent) before Saba came to NLP

He's a free agent now, experiencing weird religious hallucinations, and is just trying to fit in as an animal made hominid. 
Saba was gifted Pumpkin by her maniacal ex wizard/husband Victor who told her he was just a rat. She babied the hell out of Pumpkin due to losing her own two children, so Pumpkin never really went through the negative emotions necessary to break the enchantment. Victor figured Saba would spoil him rotten and never let him want for anything, unknowingly keeping the enchantment in place by just infantilizing the rat.

Cala fled Saba's home and hasn't seen her since he was released. She just misses him and has no idea.
At temple works, he has to given thanks for Surriel Ghena and Ma'rat Suiquinna RatLore

### Key Moments & Plot Hooks

- Cala was frozen solid by Mother Snæbjörg (similar to petrify).  In a ritual with the Shrina the Compassionate One, Cala's friends were able to bring him back with Shrina's Eternal Flame. Saved by Shrina and the Eternal Flame
SHRINA to Cala: "Let it be known: no flame is ever truly lost. In love, in sacrifice, in compassion - it endures. Rise now, child of the Eternal Flame, and walk again."
Note: You have not returned untouched. While you never died, death knows your name now and may come quicker next time. (Just make a note on your sheet: -1d4 to death saves)
- Cala and the party kill off Mother Snæbjörg in an epic lair battle

#### The Hag Mother Snæbjörg's Connection to Cala
Long ago, before Cala escaped, the he was a "subject" for the Bheur Hag Mother Snæbjörg  
Cala was one of the captives "marked" by the hag.
Cala never saw the hag directly (being blindfolded or cursed), but most of Cala's memory loss and trauma is the hag's doing.
The hag can reveal (truthfully or not) that she had planned to use Cala to open an ancient planar gate deep within the Feydark—a portal project still unfinished.
"You were special once, my Little Squeek. The Fomorians wanted your magic, but they were blind. You could have been so much more…"

### Goals

- The player of this character would like to uncover Cala's background, his past. Who was he? Where does he come from in the feywild? What is The origin of his scouting and druid skills? And how did the maniacal wizard, Victor, play into his demise?
- Later, we will discuss what the personal quest looks like to unlock this background.
- I want a feat where Cala can build a rat nest to hide / camouflage folks. He digs like a little doggo to bury them in grass/snow/twigs
