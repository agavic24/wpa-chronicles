# Ra Locke, Guardian of the Dreamflow

## PC Notes

Ra was born a changeling but lived a hidden life among mortals.  Few know of their true nature, but the party has proven trustworthy and has seen the shapeshifter in action.

Ra is a changeling that can alter their appearance and voice. Changelings are pale, with colorless eyes and silver-white hair. It is rare to see a changeling in its true form, because a typical changeling alters their shape the way others might change clothes.  With ever-changing appearances, changelings reside in many societies undetected. Each changeling can supernaturally adopt any face they like. For some changelings, a new face is only a disguise. For other changelings, a new face may reveal an aspect of their soul.
Ra has three primary forms and never uses their Changeling form.  Those forms are:

    ### Ra'mora - a devious woman elf
    A female with sharp, elegant Elven features stares at you with a cold, almond-shaped eyes of silver.  Her long, ink-black hair is tied back in a sleek braid, revealing pointed ears adorned with engraved silver cuffs. She wears a form-fitting black leather bodysuit reinforced with leather, a high-collared cloak that seems to shift in the light, and fingerless gloves meant for quick, precise movements. Strapped to her thighs are two curved daggers, while a hefty looking crossbow is slung over her shoulder.

    ### Ra'skar - an older male criminal
    A human with a broad, hooked nose and slightly crooked teeth gives you a nod and smile.  His gray hair is slicked back into a ponytail and his strong jaw is framed by a neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard.  He wears a dark, weather-stained cloak with a high collar with a well-fitted leather jerkin and a wide-brimmed hat.  A pair of fingerless gloves expose his calloused, ink-stained hands, marking him as someone familiar with both writing and weaponry. This draws your attention to the short sword he wears at his side.  You sense his streetwise charm and an untold story of survival

    ### Ra'vek - a young male adventurer
    A stout dwarf with a youthful, angular face and an easy smirk leans casually against a wall, flipping a dagger between calloused fingers. His dark, shoulder-length hair is braided loosely, the ends tied with beads made of rough-cut stone. His pale blue eyes dart about, always alert, contrasting with his rough-hewn features. He's clad in a sleeveless tunic of muted greens and browns over studded leather, his gloves and boots scuffed from long treks. A hooded cloak rests on his shoulders, the edges frayed but still serviceable.

### Motivations & Desires

1. **To maintain autonomy while fulfilling the pact**: Ra wants to serve the Maiden of the Moon and the Gloaming Court without losing themselves completely. They seek ways to exercise their own will and judgment within the bounds of their obligations, finding loopholes or creative interpretations that allow them to serve both their fey patron and their own moral compass.

2. **To reclaim control over their identity**: Despite being a changeling with multiple forms, Ra struggles with feeling like their true self is becoming lost among their masks (Ra'mora, Ra'skar, Ra'vek) and their fey-given powers. They desire to discover or rediscover who they are beyond the roles they play and the powers they've been granted.

3. **To cure the Heart of Stillwinter and restore their emotional connection**: The curse is slowly numbing Ra's emotions and making them feel more distant from others. They want to find a way to break this curse not just for practical reasons (removing the disadvantage), but to feel genuinely connected to their companions and experiences again - something that becomes increasingly precious as their fey powers threaten to distance them from their humanity.

4. **To build genuine trust and connection with the party**: Ra has spent years operating alone, using deception and multiple identities. Now that they've found companions who know some of their secrets, they want to let their guard down and form authentic relationships - though they're still learning how to do this after a lifetime of masks and survival instincts.

5. **To find their place between worlds**: Ra exists between the mortal realm and the Feywild, between criminal and agent, between changeling and humanoid. They want to find a way to reconcile these dualities rather than being torn apart by them, seeking a balance where they can honor their fey obligations while remaining grounded in the mortal world they've always known.

### Klymok (An imp)

During Ra's training in the Feywild, the Maiden of the Moon presented Klymok as a gift - a feywild spirit in imp form. The Maiden explained that Klymok would serve as Ra's eyes and ears, a loyal companion forged from the same twilight magic that flows through Ra's pact. Over time, Ra learned to call upon Klymok through the find familiar ritual. Klymok serves both Ra and, in subtle ways, the Maiden's interests, though the imp has grown genuinely fond of Ra's cunning and survival instincts.

## DM Notes

Changeling, Misfortune Bringer Rogue, Archfey Patron Warlock

### RA PLOT - What has been shared with PCs
- Ra is a changeling who carved out a place in Sigil's criminal underworld - specializing in poisons and rare contraband.
- **They struggle with finding balance and autonomy in life that is fraught with layers of secrecy, duty, and survival.**
- He has shared that he no longer in contact with his old guild after an **"incident"**.
- He has shared very little of the pact with his patron.
- He has become more distant and abrasive in recent days.

### Backstory

For many years Ra carved out a place in the criminal underworld - specializing in poisons and rare contraband.  They built up a reputation as someone who could acquire almost anything and leave no trace.
The face of Ra during most of this time was of Ra'skar - an older male human.  The front helped Ra get into high-society … and the wealthy purses of potential clients.  Ra'skar never executed any deals… Ra had another form for that, Ra'mora.

Ra spent years in this form, yet the party has never met her.  While Ra'skar was the fence or middle-man, Ra'mora was the thief or acquirer of goods that made it all possible. Her work required silence, subtlety, and an unflinching resolve - all skills she mastered with cold precision.

Several years ago, Ra'mora ventured into a shadowy black market to secure a rare and powerful toxin. The deal, however, was a setup. Three rival thieves ambushed her, hoping to end her influence permanently. They attacked, but she managed to escape during the fray.  Badly wounded and pursued through the city's underbelly, Ra'mora fled for her life.  She cried out a desperate plea to any power that might hear her.

And one power did hear.

A spectral voice called out to her as shadow and moonlight cast down upon her. The **Maiden of the Moon**, an enigmatic archfey of the Gloaming Court, offered her a pact: escape with her life in exchange for patronage to the court. Ra'mora accepted. A portal tore through reality, and Ra'mora was drawn into the Feywild. 

For the first full moon Ra'mora underwent the Trial of Twilight, a gauntlet of illusions, silent predators, and poison-forged tests, overseen by the Court. She survived not through brute strength, but by outwitting the trials - just as the Court had hoped. Recognizing her shapeshifting nature, her skill with toxins, and her liminal existence between shadow and substance, the Gloaming Court deemed her a perfect emissary.

During the next 3 cycles of the moon, Ra was taught eldritch invocations by the Maiden herself and was initiated into the "Lessons of the First Ones," arcane teachings that gave her spellcasting abilities and hardened her body and mind. In the end she became one of the **Lumenbound**, a secretive group of agents bound to the Gloaming Court.

Her pact was also sealed: she would act as the Maiden's covert agent in the mortal realm, an instrument of quiet justice and **Guardian of the Dreamflow**.

Now, Ra walks the world once more, both rogue and warlock, they past buried in shadows and they future tied to the call of the Gloaming Court.

At one point SOMEONE from the Gloaming Court trained Ra in the skills of a **Misfortune Bringer**.

Ra is a complex character - shaped by their past, the pact with the Maiden of the Moon, and their role as both a rogue and a warlock. The way they interact with others is influenced by these layers of secrecy, duty, and survival.  The results is Ra is a figure of calculated mystery, carefully managing what they reveal to others and even what they admit to themselves. The path they've chosen is fraught with complexity, and while they may be comfortable with some secrets, others weigh heavily on them—threatening to unravel the person they want to be.

    ### What Ra Is Willing to Share Upfront:
        #### Their Profession as a Fence:
        Ra is open about their expertise in acquiring and selling rare, often illicit items. They'll gladly use their skills as a negotiator or mediator when it comes to acquiring goods or dealing with shady figures. They might even proudly share the fact that they've been in the criminal trade for years, offering advice or assistance on how to navigate black markets or underworld dealings. It's a useful skill that makes them feel valuable and it's part of their identity that doesn't carry too much risk.

        #### Their Shapeshifting Abilities:
        Ra's changeling nature is not something they share opening.  It is something they may reveal in time, though they'll likely do so with a level of caution. They're willing to transform in front of the party eventually but only if it serves to build trust or gain a tactical advantage (such as assuming a new identity to escape ).

        #### Basic Warlock Pact Details (At Surface Level):
        Ra might admit that they made a pact with a powerful fey entity to gain their warlock powers. They will likely name drop "an archfey," possibly in vague terms—leaving out critical details about the Maiden of the Moon's identity. They may even describe their powers as being tied to the "mysterious forces of twilight" or "otherworldly patrons." This is a truth, but Ra will avoid going into specifics about the Maiden's true nature or the more personal, binding terms of the pact.

    ### What Ra Wants to Hide from Others
        #### The Full Extent of Their Pact with the Maiden of the Moon:
        Ra hides the full details of the pact with the Maiden of the Moon. They won't share the fact that their powers are drawn from the feywild, or that they're an emissary of the Gloaming Court. The nature of their duties, their ties to the Maiden, and the true price they've paid for their abilities remain a closely guarded secret. The party doesn't need to know how their fey patron might call upon them for specific tasks or how their fate is bound to the whims of the fey.

        #### The Role of the Maiden in Their Life:
        Ra may downplay or outright lie about the significance of the Maiden in their life. They might refer to the Maiden as an "ally" or "patron" but will never reveal that the Maiden has an ongoing, and at times controlling, influence on them. Ra doesn't want the party to know the truth: the Maiden holds strings that could pull Ra into dangerous situations or force them to choose between their mortal companions and their fey obligations.

        #### Their Fear of Losing Control:
        Ra might try to maintain an air of self-control and competence, hiding any fear they have of losing themselves in the powers granted by the Maiden. They don't want to admit that the powers they've gained might eventually consume them, turning them into something they no longer recognize.

        #### Their Vulnerability to Nightmares or Madness:
        The dream magic Ra now possesses, combined with their dealings with the Gloaming Court, leaves them susceptible to nightmares or mental instability. They may experience moments of hallucination or psychic distress from the intense link between their mind and the dreamflows, but they will keep these episodes hidden from the party. They don't want anyone to know how close they are to the edge of losing their grip on reality.

    ### What Ra Wants to Hide from Themselves:
        #### The Cost of Their Pact:
        Deep down, Ra may question whether their pact was worth it. They hide from themselves the gnawing realization that they've made a terrible bargain with a powerful and unpredictable archfey. They may justify their actions, telling themselves it's the price for survival, but the truth is, they've sacrificed a piece of their own autonomy. They fear that the more they use their fey-given powers, the less moral they'll become.

        #### Their Growing Dependence on the Feywild's Power:
        The more Ra draws on the Maiden's magic, the more they feel tied to the feyworld. They hide from themselves just how much their identity is now defined by the power granted to them. They want to believe that they're still in control, but deep down, they worry that they are slowly becoming a puppet of the Gloaming Court, bound to their will and losing the very freedom they once prized. In moments of defiance they choose to ignore their gift magic and try to get along with out it - sometimes at the risk of injury and worse.

        #### The Guilt of Being an Agent of the Fey:
        Ra struggles with an inner conflict—while they may outwardly accept their role as an agent of the Maiden and the Gloaming Court, they harbor a deep sense of guilt for using their powers to act as a covert operative, especially when it involves morally gray decisions or sacrificing others for the sake of the fey's mysterious plans. They try not to face the reality that they are, in many ways, a pawn in a larger game, manipulating events in ways that don't always align with their personal morals.
