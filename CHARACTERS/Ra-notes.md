# Ra

## PC Notes

Ra was born a fey changeling but lived a hidden life among mortals.  Few know of their  true nature, but the party has proven trustworthy and has seen the shapeshifter in action.


Ra is a changeling that can alter their appearance and voice. Changelings are pale, with colorless eyes and silver-white hair. It is rare to see a changeling in its true form, because a typical changeling alters their shape the way others might change clothes.  With ever-changing appearances, changelings reside in many societies undetected. Each changeling can supernaturally adopt any face they like. For some changelings, a new face is only a disguise. For other changelings, a new face may reveal an aspect of their soul.
Ra has three primary forms and never uses their Changeling form.  Those forms are:

    ### Ra’mora - a devious woman elf
    A female with sharp, elegant Elven features stares at you with a cold, almond-shaped eyes of silver.  Her long, ink-black hair is tied back in a sleek braid, revealing pointed ears adorned with engraved silver cuffs. She wears a form-fitting black leather bodysuit reinforced with leather, a high-collared cloak that seems to shift in the light, and fingerless gloves meant for quick, precise movements. Strapped to her thighs are two curved daggers, while a hefty looking crossbow is slung over her shoulder.


    ### Ra’skar - an older male criminal
    A human with a broad, hooked nose and slightly crooked teeth gives you a nod and smile.  His gray hair is slicked back into a ponytail and his strong jaw is framed by a neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard.  He wears a dark, weather-stained cloak with a high collar with a well-fitted leather jerkin and a wide-brimmed hat.  A pair of fingerless gloves expose his calloused, ink-stained hands, marking him as someone familiar with both writing and weaponry. This draws your attention to the short sword he wears at his side.  You sense his streetwise charm and an untold story of survival


    ### Ra’vek - a young male adventurer
    A stout dwarf with a youthful, angular face and an easy smirk leans casually against a wall, flipping a dagger between calloused fingers. His dark, shoulder-length hair is braided loosely, the ends tied with beads made of rough-cut stone. His pale blue eyes dart about, always alert, contrasting with his rough-hewn features. He’s clad in a sleeveless tunic of muted greens and browns over studded leather, his gloves and boots scuffed from long treks. A hooded cloak rests on his shoulders, the edges frayed but still serviceable.

###  Backstory
For many years Ra carved out a place in the criminal underworld - specializing in poisons and rare contraband.  They built up a reputation as someone who could acquire almost anything and leave no trace.
The face of Ra during most of this time was of Ra’skar - an older male human.  The front helped Ra get into high-society … and the wealthy purses of potential clients.  Ra’skar never executed any deals… Ra had another form for that, Ra’mora.

Ra spent years in this form, yet the party has never met her.  While Ra’vek was the fence or middle-man, Ra’mora was the thief or acquirer of goods that made it all possible. Her work required silence, subtlety, and an unflinching resolve - all skills she mastered with cold precision.

Several years ago, Ra’mora ventured into a shadowy black market to secure a rare and powerful toxin. The deal, however, was a setup. Three rival thieves ambushed her, hoping to end her influence permanently. They attacked, but she managed to escape during the fray.  Badly wounded and pursued through the city’s underbelly, Ra’mora fled for her life.  She cried out a desperate plea to any power that might hear her.

And one power did hear.

A spectral voice called out to her as shadow and moonlight cast down upon her. The Maiden of the Moon, an enigmatic archfey of the Gloaming Court, offered her a pact: escape with her life in exchange for patronage to the court. Ra’mora accepted. A portal tore through reality, and Ra’mora was drawn into the Feywild. 

For the first full moon Ra’mora underwent the Trial of Twilight, a gauntlet of illusions, silent predators, and poison-forged tests, overseen by the Court. She survived not through brute strength, but by outwitting the trials - just as the Court had hoped. Recognizing her shapeshifting nature, her skill with toxins, and her liminal existence between shadow and substance, the Gloaming Court deemed her a perfect emissary.

During the next 3 cycles of the moon, Ra was taught eldritch invocations by the Maiden herself and was initiated into the “Lessons of the First Ones,” arcane teachings that gave her spellcasting abilities and hardened her body and mind. In the end she became one of the Lumenbound, a secretive group of agents bound to the Gloaming Court.

Her pact was also sealed: she would act as the Maiden’s covert agent in the mortal realm, an instrument of quiet justice and Guardian of the Dreamflow.

Now, Ra walks the world once more, both rogue and warlock, her past buried in shadows and her future tied to the call of the Gloaming Court.
