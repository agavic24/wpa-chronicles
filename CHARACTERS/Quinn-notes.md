# Quinn

## PC Notes

Quinn is a 5'4" seal bicolor ragdoll cat Tabaxi with brown markings, steel blue eyes, and an off white/cream base coat color. She's particular about keeping her fur clean, so she is always wearing clothing or armor over the majority of her body, save for her hands, feet, tail, and head. Her tail is kept close by her, curled around her feet or behind her to prevent anyone from stepping on it, less someone fancies claws down their skin. Her dark ears always scan her surroundings, listening for anything - or anyone - that might be nearby. Her  eyes are open and curious, always watching her surroundings to match her flicking ears.

She has a small scar on her left lower lip that she says is from dagger practice but really, she just scraped her lip with her tooth.
Quinn usually wears her darker leather armor, but in the warmer months she dons greens and browns, with a forest green cape strapped to her shoulders by a golden acorn clasp.

Quinn is usually found fiddling with a gold piece, whittling a piece of wood, or rolling dice around in her hand, awaiting a game she will likely not win.

### Backstory

Quinn is the only child of a father and mother who were constantly working. Out of the house most days, she had to scrounge for her own food and necessities, often outside of the home itself. At one point, she became hopelessly lost during a festival and was unable to find her way back home after that. She made friends with orphans and petty thieves who had learned the ways of the streets and could help her stand on her own two feet. She spent many nights hungry, but pushed forward when she knew there was no reason to die so soon. When she became older, she needed to defend herself more frequently, and snagged a old but sturdy dagger from a passing merchant. She practiced daily with it and it became her most prized possession. She used the skills to enter into an underground society, taking on simple jobs of nabbing food or killing a wandering beast for those involved and splitting the spoils with the members. It was easier to convince herself to push forward when she had others lives depending on her. It was a few years before the group was discovered by authorities and scattered the members across the continent, leaving her all alone once again. With no home to go to anymore, she wandered from town to town, picking up a few jobs to gain enough money to venture forward. Her days always ended at a tavern or bar, where games were plenty and alcohol flowed freely. She watched for a long time, intrigued by the mechanics of each one and how the people reacted by cheers or thrown tables. Despite the chaos, it was a community, and she edged her way into it over time until one evening when a pair of dice were shoved into her hand. The group shouted, telling her to roll them, and in her panic she tossed them, only for them to end up rolling a 7. Something about the group's simultaneous cheers and criticizing was enticing, and when she rolled yet another 7, the high was too big to ignore. Quinn proceeded to play at every town, seeing where her luck would take her each night. If the night went well, she spent another day, and if she got one too many poor rolls, her bag was packed and she was gone by sunrise. With the excitement she receives by being among the crowd, she now wishes to find her own place, somewhere she can settle with her own little tavern and hopefully be the stop for many adventurers wishing for their luck to change.

It's easy to catch onto schemes when you know common tells. A glance, a breath, a finger twitch. A single moment was all it took for her to take control. Cards, dice, even darts had a way of falling under her claws and scrutiny, to the chagrin of anyone who sat at her table. They'd call her a liar, a cheat, maybe even a thief, just for using her instinct. A cat studies its prey intently, waiting for the perfect time to pounce. It wasn't her fault that she used what she was given. Some nights, when she found something good and didn't want to tempt the fates, she'd watch the game tables from the rafters or a balcony, picking someone to watch each round just to test her deduction. It became easier and easier to read their faces like the page of a book. One she kept on her person at all times, in fact. Over time it became harder to read, with memories fading or faces smudged like ink, but she kept it in herself in the off chance she ever ran across a particularly stoic foe again in the future. With the practice from nights at the tavern, it was almost nature to sit and watch everything as days went on. Life became so much more interesting once truths began crawling to her, and she leaned in close to see. She knew exactly when the baker Toma would bring out his pies, and what flavors they were depending on what side his apron was used the most. A dragonborn Kilrune followed the sacred path of a paladin, but kept a lover who tested his very faith. Whenever King Maddox's carriage rolled through town, the local healer Elide would mysteriously close her clinic, doors locked and curtains drawn. A world hiding its open secrets, and she formed the pages of her own book of tales, itching to read the souls of anyone willing to sit at her table. Even if just to win a single roll of the dice. There was nothing more thrilling than catching her prey off guard and sinking her claws in deep.
