# Darias of Stone and Fire

## PC Notes

Class: Wildfire Druid, Efreeti Genie Warlock
Species: Stone Goliath
Pronouns: He/Him
Height: 7'
Weight: 200 lbs.
Languages: Common, Giant, Draconic, Druidic

Darias is tall, a descendent of Stone Giants. His shock white hair is the color of white quartz. He grew up in a medium sized viallage of Stone Goliaths where everyone knew everyone else. As a youth he was wild and trouble if he wasn't working in the Forge as a Smith's Apprentice.  He often snuck out of the forge or his house to cause small trouble, and he eventually became quite proficient at not getting caught!  He was called to Druidry because a elemental wildfire spirit, Cinder, was bound to him (he knows not how). The Wildfire circle of Druids has acknowledged him, and Druid Karrig first taught him, but they are a circle only in name (anarchists of the world unite and all). Darias seeks balance, but sometimes that balance requires a cleansing fire to start over. He is chaotic neutral... a blend of wild fire and balance.

Cinder once enabled Darias to commune with the elemental plane of fire and he made a Pact with a noble Efreeti Genie. The Efreeti wants to watch the world burn, but Darias only agreed he would burn the parts throwing the world out of balance. Darias does not know the true name of the Efreeti, and he doesn't care. 

#### Pandora
Through the Efreeti's power Darias is able to summon two powerful familiars. Pandora is a Sphinx of Wonder, and she delights in learning magic, especially fire magic. Pandora is almost always with Darias and studying some old texts (she is a bit smarter than Darias). Grudge is an Imp, as evil and ruthless as you'd expect. Grudge however tried to cross the Efreeti's will and in exchange for his life was bound to servitude. Darias will summon Grudge, but only when his stealth and invisibility are required.

#### Cinder
He was called to Druidry because a elemental wildfire spirit, Cinder, was bound to him (he knows not how). The Wildfire circle of Druids has acknowledged him, and Druid Karrig first taught him, but they are a circle only in name (anarchists of the world unite and all). Darias seeks balance, but sometimes that balance requires a cleansing fire to start over. He is chaotic neutral... a blend of wild fire and balance.

#### Druid: Circle of Wildfire 
He was called to Druidry because an elemental wildfire spirit, Cinder, was bound to him (he knows not how). The Wildfire circle of Druids has acknowledged him, but they are a circle only in name (anarchists of the world unite and all). Darias seeks balance, but sometimes that balance requires a cleansing fire to start over. He is chaotic neutral... a blend of wild fire and balance.

"Master Karrig, he was my teacher and Druid of the Wildfire Circle. I don't have a way to reach him, no. The Wildfire circle is perhaps less connected than most circles, it seems to me that those called to it are more go their own way and less organized."

#### Warlock Patron - Shahzari the Ashen Queen
- Personality: Shahzari the Ashen Queen is a being of searing intensity, her presence both mesmerizing and merciless. She is regal yet wrathful, a monarch who sees hesitation as weakness and mercy as a failing. Her words are honeyed embers—seductive, yet burning with hidden cruelty. She delights in negotiation not for fairness, but for the slow pleasure of watching others realize too late that they have already lost. To her, destruction is not chaos but refinement, a necessary purging that only the strong survive. Those who serve her are kindling, meant to burn brightly or be reduced to ash—there is no in-between.
- Motivation: Shahzari believes that true balance is found only when everything has burned away and is reborn in flame. She sees herself as the great purifier of the world, erasing corruption and weakness to make way for a stronger order. She has no patience for hesitation or sentimentality—fire consumes, and so should Darias.
- Interest in Darias: She sees Darias as a reluctant ember of destruction, one who does not yet understand that fire does not negotiate. She guides him to embrace his destructive potential, testing his limits and punishing hesitation. She grants him power, but always with a searing lesson—kindling a fire only to snuff it out if he disappoints her.
- Vision Test: Shahzari gives Darias a vision test during an evening of rest. The intent is to establish the warlock's pact terms.  Darias gains power, but must accept his role as a instrument of destruction. The vision reinforces the power structure,  tests his ruthlessness, and shares the belief system where destruction of the weak serves a greater purpose.  If Darias passes the test, he will receive his Genie Vessel (Ring with a comparment) and a stern warning not to challenge the patron's authority.

#### Cinder: Wildfire Spirit
Cinder was the means of the party's escape while innocents died in the Shrine of Shrina; her Fiery Teleportation becomes unreliable when used around groups of humanoids. The spirit must make a Charisma saving throw (DC 14). On a fail, the spirit refuses the command entirely unless the player makes a DC 15 Persuasion check to "convince" it.

#### Pandora
Through the Efreeti's power Darias is able to summon Pandora, a powerful familiar and Sphinx of Wonder.
She delights in learning magic, especially fire magic.
Pandora is almost always with Darias and studying some old texts (she is a bit smarter than Darias).
Taken on a friendship with Cala
