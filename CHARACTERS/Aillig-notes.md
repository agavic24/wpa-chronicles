# Aillig McCaird

## PC Notes

Human Artificer
Aillig's moral compass is strictly aligned to rigid adherence to legally binding contracts between magical beings/groups and/or humanoid populations. His job as a sigil agent was to act as a mediator in negotiations, to prepare, certify and store the contracts, and to enforce penalty clauses for breaches of the contracts.

Aillig's belief system is based in the energy that ties everything together and the use of proper forms and symbols to bind things in certain ways. He has dealt with too many demi (or potentially greater) deities' contracts to see them as anything other than normal beings with inordinate amounts of power. His experimental "elixirs" are like a meditative exercise in the vein of zen gardens.

### DM to PC: Where do you think your character's head and heart are at after everything that’s happened so far?
    I think that he would be wearied, but trying to put on a stoic determined façade with the whole 'elder statesman' thing. I think that his mind would also keep wandering to both the cube and the seed. The first nagging as an unsolved riddle and the second with a sense as it being a ticking bomb.

### DM to PC: Is there anything you’d love to explore more deeply this time around - with your character, the world, the story?
    - Play up the taken apart/put back together bit from the dream; it’s like a meditation… a full body scan...but is it more? (see dream below). What caused it? Is it the influence of the seed etc., being in this different place, something related to all the energy that was flying around with the defeat of the hag (maybe tying in with the part of his origin story where his mentor got to him in the swamp before a hag did)  or something else (god, fey whatever.)  
    - Play into the feat he'll get at level 12.
    - Would like to explore his Tinker's Magic ability (allows magically crafting mundane objects into existance until dawn the next day). For flavor, Aillig will create a paper oragami of the item and then it will pop into existence.  At least initially, he wouldn't know how it was working, and someone (who??) will need to leave him a message with a clue how to use this ability (and then the message will vanish at dawn).
    - Will find a peer for experimenting with on new elixer infusions

### Motivations & Desires


### Vision Dreams

- As they sit around resting, Aillig pulls out his kit and begins drawing sigils free form, attempting to use the usually meditative process to help drain the tension that still plagues him, even out of that fridgid place, but the calm will not come. Sighing, he falls back on an old trick his mentor taught him for processing events and putting them in perspective. Picking up a discarded attempt at a sigil that just wouldn't seem to take, he begins to fold the paper, and fold and fold. The relaxation of the process eventually lulling him to sleep, Aillig falls into a deep dream, vivid, yet also surreal. Later he would only be able to recall a sense of being taken apart and examined. Pulled down to the base of who he was, and then put back together, this way and that, until whole again. Waking, he has a sense of being, somehow, not quite the same, in a way that he can't quite put a finger on. At first he thinks it is that some of his belongings, ones that he infuses will power, are missing. But then as if willed into existence, there they are, right where they should be. Still, there is something but he just can't put his finger on it. He feels as if he has gained some knowledge of sigils, but that is not unusual after experiences like they had gone through, new patterns becoming clear as he processes what has happened. No, it was something else.
