# Aillig McCaird

## PC Notes
Human Artificer
Aillig's moral compass is strictly aligned to rigid adherence to legally binding contracts between magical beings/groups and/or humanoid populations. His job as a sigil agent was to act as a mediator in negotiations, to prepare, certify and store the contracts, and to enforce penalty clauses for breaches of the contracts.

Aillig's belief system is based in the energy that ties everything together and the use of proper forms and symbols to bind things in certain ways. He has dealt with too many demi (or potentially greater) deities' contracts to see them as anything other than normal beings with inordinate amounts of power. His experimental "elixirs" are like a meditative exercise in the vein of zen gardens.
