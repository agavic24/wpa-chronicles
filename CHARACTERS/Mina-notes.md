# Mina'Khor Delhin 

## PC Notes

Mina'Khor, a towering figure standing at 7ft tall, is a half-giant, half-fey barbarian. Her broad physique, akin to an ancient oak tree in both its grandeur and solidity, exudes an air of jovial humor that belies her intimidating stature.

Her skin carries an ethereal hint of copper that dances with an otherworldly shimmer. Intriguingly, her eyes and hair share the same vibrant pink color; the former radiates with a mischievous glint while the latter cascades down her back like a waterfall of wild roses.  A chromatic feather is tied within the pink hair, a good luck charm from her new friend Feligrin.

Traditional loose pants clothed her lower body, matched with a simple wrap protecting her chest. From wrists to elbows, she flaunts bangles that chime softly with each powerful movement she makes.

Two large elk-like horns proudly stand atop her head, acting as a clear badge of her unique lineage. Sometimes, spectral butterflies - manifestations of her ancestral spirits - flutter around her horns and bangles in a mesmerizing dance.  

She carries a colossal glaive that carries more than mere metal; it is an extension of her spirit itself. When battle cries echo through the air, she unleashes the fury housed within herself - a blaze of Fey and Giant heritage that can strike awe even into the hearts of the fiercest warriors.

She’s the child of a fey and a stone giant. The fey mom is no noble but works around one tending the moonstone dragons in their household and has decent power. Father is a stone giant who is very slowly (thanks to feywild being all wonky) descending towards being a dream walker since he’s not staying in the stone halls where he belongs. 

Mina’s mother worries a lot because she’s an oddity in all regards. She’s secured her work for the noble fey as a guard, but Mina wasn’t ever really interested in being the prim and proper vanguard everyone wants her to be for her own safety. So she’s very much gotten into a bit of trouble. Currently a bargain makes it so she can only go out of her work for the noble when they allow her to or when she’s not on duty else (undetermined consequences I’ve not entirely thought out). 

She wants to explore the wider world behind the feywilds where her father comes from. Taste real danger, and get stronger. Actually be able to well use the abilities she’s manifested to channel the ancestors of both family sides for the good of those who need aid.
