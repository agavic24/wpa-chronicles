# Mina'Khor Delhin 

## PC Notes

Mina'Khor, a towering figure standing at 7ft tall, is a half-giant, half-fey barbarian. Her broad physique, akin to an ancient oak tree in both its grandeur and solidity, exudes an air of jovial humor that belies her intimidating stature.

Her skin carries an ethereal hint of copper that dances with an otherworldly shimmer. Intriguingly, her eyes and hair share the same vibrant pink color; the former radiates with a mischievous glint while the latter cascades down her back like a waterfall of wild roses.  A chromatic feather is tied within the pink hair, a good luck charm from her new friend Feligrin.

Traditional loose pants clothed her lower body, matched with a simple wrap protecting her chest. From wrists to elbows, she flaunts bangles that chime softly with each powerful movement she makes.

Two large elk-like horns proudly stand atop her head, acting as a clear badge of her unique lineage. Sometimes, spectral butterflies - manifestations of her ancestral spirits - flutter around her horns and bangles in a mesmerizing dance.  

She carries a colossal glaive that carries more than mere metal; it is an extension of her spirit itself. When battle cries echo through the air, she unleashes the fury housed within herself - a blaze of Fey and Giant heritage that can strike awe even into the hearts of the fiercest warriors.

She's the child of a fey and a stone giant. The fey mom is no noble, but works around one and has decent respect within the community. She worries a lot because Mina's an oddity in all regards. Mom also has a deep secret.  She is the last remaining guardian the moonstone dragon pact.

Father is a stone giant who is very slowly descending towards being a dream walker (thanks to feywild being all wonky), since he's not staying in the stone halls where he belongs. 

Mina's secured her work for the noble fey as a guard, but she wasn't ever really interested in being the prim and proper vanguard everyone wants her to be for her own safety. So she's very much gotten into a bit of trouble. Currently a bargain makes it so she can only go out of her work for the noble when they allow her to or when she's not on duty else (undetermined consequences I've not entirely thought out). 

She wants to explore the wider world behind the feywilds where her father comes from. Taste real danger, and get stronger. Actually be able to well use the abilities she's manifested to channel the ancestors of both family sides for the good of those who need aid.

### Backstory

Your mother's family has a longstanding pack with moonstone dragons that stretches back many generations.
The moonstone dragons allow you and your mother to use their fey crossing with the understanding that they may entrust you to carry messages, retrieve magic items or information for them from time to time.
You know where this fey crossing is - you used it to get here.  It's in the Woodlands.  You're not suppose to tell anyone about it.
You're overdue for returning to the feywild ... or, at least, this is now turning into your longest stint away and you're not sure how your mother will take the news.
Your mom like's rubies.

Mina has crossed between the feywild and NLP multiple times, but always under strict supervision.
Her mother first brought her to the redwood fairy circle when she was very young. The moment the luminous portal shimmered to life, the moonstone dragons appeared—not in their full, awe-inspiring forms, but as flickering outlines atop the redwoods, curious and cautious. One of the younger moonstone dragons, Velisar Moonrock, took an interest in Mina immediately. He found her half-giant heritage fascinating; her connection to stone reminded him of ancient lunar mountains and resonant minerals buried in moonlight. Over the years, Mina was allowed to cross for: training missions, deliveries of moon-charged reagents, errands that required her physical strength or keen instincts, occasional "lessons" from the moonstone dragons on sensing hidden magic or reading the subtle shifts of moonlight. These crossings became part of her upbringing. She views them not with reverence, but with the fearless curiosity typical of her wild nature. But every crossing was controlled. And she was always accompanied by her mother or a watching moonstone dragon. Mina has never been allowed to cross alone.
