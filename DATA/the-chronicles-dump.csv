*Everyone can see it‚Äôs a compact, intricately crafted cube roughly 5‚Äù on each side with an exterior of polished brass and dark wood. Small geometric patterns are etched in the sides and tiny, arcane runes pulse faintly into view when touched. The occasional whirr of hidden gears can be heard from within.*

*As Aillig turns the cube over and over in careful study, the ancient design is unlike anything you‚Äôve seen and it resists all attempts to open.  After nearly an hour of twisting and testing you‚Äôre about to give up when you finally discover something!  If you press a specific sequence of runes on one side, a tiny hole opens on the opposite side. Perhaps the cube just needs a key now‚Ä¶ or the right tool for the job.*
