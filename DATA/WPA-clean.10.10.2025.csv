Note:Whenever you finish a long rest, you can magically produce an _experimental elixir_ in an empty flask you touch. Roll on the Experimental Elixir table for the elixir's effect, which is triggered when someone drinks the elixir. As an action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to an incapacitated creature.

You can create additional _experimental elixirs_ by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher for each one. When you do so, you use your action to create the elixir in an empty flask you touch, and you choose the elixir's effect from the Experimental Elixir table.

Creating an _experimental elixir_ requires you to have alchemist's supplies on your person, and any elixir you create with this feature lasts until it is drunk or until the end of your next long rest.

When you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more elixirs at the end of a long rest: two at 6th level and three at 15th level. Roll for each elixir's effect separately. Each elixir requires its own flask."

Note:You attempt to craft an illusion in the mind of a creature you can see within range. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other phenomenon that is no larger than a 10-foot Cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. The phantasm includes sound, tem- perature, and other stimuli. The target can take a Study action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.,
Note:While affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real and rationalizes any il- logical outcomes from interacting with it. For exam- ple, if the target steps through a phantasmal bridge and survives the fall, it believes the bridge exists and something else caused it to fall. An affected target can even take damage from the illusion if the phantasm represents a dangerous creature or hazard. On each of your turns, such a phantasm can deal 2d8 Psychic damage to the tar- get if it is in the phantasm’s area or within 5 feet of the phantasm.

Potions to mend, for your strength to last.
Each vial holds care, each drop a boon,
To guide your way ‘neath sun or moon.""

The liquid in the cauldron duplicates the properties of a Common or an Uncommon potion of your choice (such as a Potion of Healing).

Note:**Resilience.** The drinker gains a +1 bonus to AC for 10 minutes.,
Note:**Healing.** The drinker regains a number of hit points equal to 2d4 + your Intelligence modifier.,
Note:Whenever you finish a long rest, you can magically produce an _experimental elixir_ in an empty flask you touch. Roll on the Experimental Elixir table for the elixir's effect, which is triggered when someone drinks the elixir. As an action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to an incapacitated creature.

You can create additional _experimental elixirs_ by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher for each one. When you do so, you use your action to create the elixir in an empty flask you touch, and you choose the elixir's effect from the Experimental Elixir table.

Creating an _experimental elixir_ requires you to have alchemist's supplies on your person, and any elixir you create with this feature lasts until it is drunk or until the end of your next long rest.

When you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more elixirs at the end of a long rest: two at 6th level and three at 15th level. Roll for each elixir's effect separately. Each elixir requires its own flask."

At the center of the cottage a towering four-sided stone fireplace dominates the space, its hearth radiating warmth into separate areas of the rustic cottage.*

*Within the flickering firelight of this initial space, you see an old man is sitting just ahead in a well-worn leather armchair. Upon the floor are several well-stuffed cushions and thick, woven blankets.*

*When you open the case you see a delicate brass compass nestled in soft velvet. The craftsmanship is exquisite, the filigree markings on the casing swirling like vines entwined with tiny, unfamiliar runes. Unlike an ordinary compass, this one has two needles.  One clearly points north, but the other does not move at all.*

**“The one who gave me that, wasn’t exactly of this world. A visitor from the Feywild, passing through as they sometimes do, when the veil is thin.

*Edrik leans forward slightly, his gaze flickers toward Cala and becomes serious.*

**“It’s not just a trinket, mind you. It listens. It won’t work for just anyone, not without knowing the right word.

**“The Crimson Grove. You passed its guardian on your way here - the ancient oak. That was no ordinary tree. It was planted and enchanted by a Fey Lord, long ago.”**

*Edrik exhales, watching Cala’s reaction.*

**“This compass has served me well, but I think it’s time it found a new owner. A gift… for you. Perhaps it will help you find your answers.”**

*He grins, mischief glinting behind his age-clouded eyes.*

Any creature that can’t see the area when the spell is cast must take a Search action and succeed on a Wisdom (Perception or Survival) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.,

"51","18002420","East Island: Frozen River","Calabaza","*Cala wings it over to Aillig once he sights the caster and his bonfire through the snow, joining him and peppering the group with many many questions, being very overstimulated*
""Hoo! Alive and absolutely over all this excitement for the day! Anyone else surprised this frozen river broke up when it did? It's been solid since I've been here.  What was the big ice lizardy thing? Nearly nipped my tail right off! Since when did wolves burp ice? Do you think there's a fire counterpart to the ice thingamajig and that's what warmed the river? Anyone else hungry? I'm hungry!"""
"51","18002430","East Island: Frozen River","Aillig","""My dear... Well, yes I would not be surprised to find that a fire lizard similar but opposed to that beast exists. As to the ice breathing wolves, I have not seen such things before, and would rather not again. They were NOT very friendly. As to the last..."" *Aillig reaches into his bag and takes out a ration pack, opening it up and handing some to Cala.* ""I too, could eat before we press on."""
"51","18002440","East Island: Frozen River","Quinn","*As soon as Quinn reaches land, she plops down and lays back, taking in deep breaths. All the adrenaline from crossing the ice and fighting unwelcome enemies had fled, leaving her fatigued. The snow was a comfortable cushion beneath her.* ""Food sounds nice about now..."""
"51","18002450","East Island: Frozen River","Darias","*Darias is already reclined by the fire and eating some rations. Some food and some rest sound fantastic.*

*Darias also brings out some incense and calms his mind to bring Pandora back into this realm*

By the time Darias came over, Ra’vek was struggling to stand.  As a wave of healing energy washes over him he looks up at Darias and whispers… * “Thank you.”

*With wounds closing, Ra’vek slowly makes his way over to the bonfire with Klymok following by his side.*

“Yes, Yes… I’ll be fine, Kly… We’ve been through worse… I just need a minute to warm up.”"
"51","18002480","East Island: Frozen River","Darias","*Darias uses one of his newer abilities, Magical Cunning, to restore one of his pact magic slots. Ah... that's good to have a little magic left*

""Quinn, if you're still seriously hurt I have one magic spell left and I could heal you more. That last heal was... anemic. Sorry. Or I could hold on to this last spell in case of some other emergency."""
"51","18002490","East Island: Frozen River","Quinn","*Quinn hears Darias and lifts a hand to wave off the idea.* ""I'll be alright, I've got a potion in my bag...I'm just taking a second."" *Her hand flops back down to lay on the ground next to her.* ""But thank you for the offer. Save it for a worse circumstance, should we run into it."""
"51","18002500","East Island: Frozen River","Aillig","*There being no burnable wood around, Aillig continues renewing the bonfire for a while to allow everyone to warm up. After a bit he looks up from the casting and asks.* “Are we ready to get back to moving?”"

"51","18002520","East Island: Frozen River","Dungeon Master","> *It’s late afternoon… Maybe just an hour or two of daylight left. The wind and snow is beginning to pick up again.*"

"51","18002550","East Island: Frozen River","Dungeon Master",">>> *Gathering around the map, Aillig traces the route with his gloved fingers, the parchment stiff from the cold. The route follows the river westward and upstream, towards the distant mountains. While the forest provided some cover before, this next stretch looks exposed. You see nothing but an open expanse with blowing wind and snow.  Another storm on the horizon creeps ever closer.  If you’re going to move, now is the time.*"
"51","18002560","East Island: Frozen River","Aillig","*looking to the sky Aillig frowns* “We should get moving so as to not get caught out in the weather.”"
"51","18002570","East Island: Frozen River","Quinn","*Quinn has sat up and dusted the snow off of her, feeling a little better now that she's gotten a moment to catch her breath. She stands and walks over to Aillig, watching him trace their path on the map.* ""Yeah, probably a good idea. I'd rather not see what else that storm is hiding."" *She shivers at the thought.*"
"51","18002580","East Island: Frozen River","Dungeon Master",">>> *The party gathers their things and begins to head west up the river.*

*Less than an hour into the trek, the storm takes hold. The wind rises and howls across the tundra, sending needles of ice cutting through your clothing.  The falling snow starts to thicken again, but it’s the wind and drifting snow that’s really the problem.  There’s little talking within the party… everyone is bundled into their layers.  With just 30 minutes left before the sun goes down, you must find shelter soon… this is the kind of storm you won’t survive overnight.*"
"51","18002590","East Island: Frozen River","Dungeon Master",">>> *Just as the cold seems unbearable, Cala notices something unusual along the riverbank - a break in the snow where a large dark stone peeks through. As you investigate, the stone reveals the mouth of a shallow cave!  Mostly sealed by drifting snow, a faint mist clings to the ground.  Cala is quick to point out that this indicates the air inside is warmer.*

*You all quickly lower your heads and step in, eager to get out of the storm.  The difference is immediate.  The howling wind dulls to a distant whisper and the blizzard’s fury cannot get in.  The walls glisten with frost and ice, refracting what little light you carry.  It’s not a big space, but you will be able to comfortably huddle here together.  While the storm continues to rage outside, you set your things down as the last rays of light disperse outside.*
(What do you do as you prepare for the evening?)"
"51","18002600","East Island: Frozen River","Quinn","*Quinn settles down in a spot against the wall, slumping off her pack and pulling out her bedroll to sit on. She's still not fond of all this cold, but ice and snow was easier to clean off than swamp water or mud. She munches on the last of her jerky and, remembering that Pandora was a fan of it last time, tosses her a piece as well.* ""Well...how excited is everyone to wake up to tons of snowfall tomorrow?"" *She chirps.*"
"51","18002610","East Island: Frozen River","Calabaza","*Yawning, Cala pulls out a small double-layer potato sack that serves as his bedroll and wraps it around himself*
""Not very excited at all, to be honest.""
*Cala pulls out the compass and whispers 'Rinnethil' to it, shaking it*"
"51","18002620","East Island: Frozen River","Calabaza","""Should we take turns watching? I'm worried the dogs have hungry friends out there."""
"51","18002630","East Island: Frozen River","Dungeon Master","> *The small compass needle spins wildly for a moment before becoming motionless once again.  You do take a note of the larger needle and it appears to be functioning as expected; it indicates you were traveling west.*"
"51","18002640","East Island: Frozen River","Ra’vek","“Good idea.  I’ll take the last watch.  Just wake me when it’s time.  I need to crash for now.” *Ra then lays out his bedroll and unapologetically falls asleep within minutes.*"
"51","18002650","East Island: Frozen River","Quinn","*Quinn is impressed by how fast Ra falls asleep, which causes her to yawn and move to laying down.* ""I'll take whichever watch is second..."" *She peers at Cala and the watch curiously, but asks nothing of it as she makes herself as comfortable as she can, gazing up at the ceiling of the small cave and listening to the quiet winds blowing outside.*"
"51","18002660","East Island: Frozen River","Darias","*Darias offers to take a shift of watch. He sets up his bed roll.*

“…”

“Yes Pandora, perhaps you were right that a Ring of Warmth should be next on our crafting list. But a cloak of protection …”"
"51","18002670","East Island: Frozen River","Dungeon Master","> (No room for tent, just bedrolls. Roughly 10’x12’ and 4’ tall at highest point.  Lots of crawling around for most)"
"51","18002680","East Island: Frozen River","Dungeon Master",">>> *Over the course of Cala’s watch the blizzard outside blows hard. Snow continues to pile against the cave entrance ensuring that nothing outside would notice this cave.*
(What do you do during the shift transition?)"
"51","18002690","East Island: Frozen River","Calabaza","*Knowing the suffocation is possible without air exchange, Cala puts a stick upright in the mouth of the cave to leave a small space where the snow does not completely seal them off. When he feels its been long enough and he is bored enough, Cala slides up stiffly from where he sat on the stone floor, shuffling quietly over to Quinn to wake her. He taps her with a paw*
""Psst...your turn, Miss Quinn."""
"51","18002700","East Island: Frozen River","Quinn","*Quinn wakes with Cala's tapping, stretching out her arms.* ""Thank you, Mister Calabaza."" *She sits up and lets the ratkin take his rest. The cat braces her back against the wall and pulls out her scimitar to lay at her side, then her bracers craft, working on it with her ears turned towards the storm. On occasion, she'd roll a few dice in her hand, curious if they'd share any knowledge of the day ahead. The results spoke nothing. When the hours had passed, she picked up her weapon and tapped Darias' shoulder.* ""Your turn."""
"51","18002710","East Island: Frozen River","Darias","*Darias stirs... when he sits up he bumps his head on the very low ceiling*

""Ow"" *he says sleepily*

""Thank you Quinn. Anything of note, or all quiet?""

*Darias settles himself into a spot that has the highest ceiling, so he can sit without still stooping. And with a cleansing breadth he settles his focus on listening and looking for trouble.*"
"51","18002720","East Island: Frozen River","Quinn","*Quinn shrugs, putting her scimitar and craft away before laying down on her roll.* ""Nothing of note, but don't let that let down your guard..."" *She yawns and settles in, falling asleep rather quickly, the craft having relaxed her. Occasionally in her dreams, a certain white fox drifted through, appearing through the snow that followed her into her mind.*"
"51","18002730","East Island: Frozen River","Darias","""Aye, don't want to get surprised""

*And Pandora joins Darias, to keep him company and keep watch*"
"51","18002740","East Island: Frozen River","Ra’vek","*Raw wakes up and see Darias and Pandora off to the side.  Without waking the others he puts the final touches on his craft - a new magical belt.  He holds it up Darias with a wide smile; the belt hide looks unmistakably similar to one gator you fought a few days back.*"
"51","18002750","East Island: Frozen River","Dungeon Master",">>> *The rest of the party eventually awakens. Due to Cala’s smart, thinking, you’re able to pull the stick out and enjoy some crisp fresh morning air. The entrance of the small cave was completely blown shut with drifting snow and ice, but after a few minutes of pounding and digging, you’re able to get out. As you look around, it’s clear there was a huge blizzard last night. All traces of your tracks are gone as 2 to 3 feet of fresh powder blankets the river and shoreline.*
(The day is yours, what do you do?)"
"51","18002760","East Island: Frozen River","Darias","*Darias looks over to see the pride in Ra's work and his excitement having finished the very stylish belt.*

""Nice work Ra, tis a fine crafting and I'm looking forward to seeing it's use in practice"""
"51","18002770","East Island: Frozen River","Quinn","*Quinn wakes mostly rested, a soft smile on her face as she stretches out again and grabs her things. Once out in the snow, she wants to bound through the soft fall, but knows that would be a poor decision nor would they have the time. She does, however, bend down to wrap up some of the snow into a ball, throwing it at Cala with a smirk before she runs, as fast as you can through snow, away from the cave.*"
"51","18002780","East Island: Frozen River","Ra’vek","“Thanks Darius! I found a dwarvish tome in the city that described how to craft this. Its magic calls upon ancient spirits to bring protection and strength.”

*Ra’vek tries it on, giving it a good tug. For a moment you swear you see a slight shimmer wrap around Ra.  He looks around momentarily, eyes wide.*

“Hmmm… I think I just heard someone.  An old dwarven woman… something about `Bringing honor and being strong.’”"
"51","18002790","East Island: Frozen River","Dungeon Master","> *Quinn quickly realizes this extra snow is going to be a problem as it comes up to her waist.  It will be a slow walk today.*"
"51","18002800","East Island: Frozen River","Aillig","""Ever onward?"" *Asks Aillig, pulling out the map.*"
"51","18002810","East Island: Frozen River","Darias","""...""

""Yes Pandora, Ring of Water Walking is definitely on the list too... being able to just walk on top of the snow would be so much better.""

*Darias can easily clear the snow with his long strides, but it's still slow going*"
"51","18002820","East Island: Frozen River","Calabaza","*Awakening, he is bopped by snow and bowled over in surprise. He sits up, shaking his fur and whiskers free of snow*
""Brrrr! Brisk! That'll wake a rat from the dead. C'mere you cheeky thing!""
*Cala flies after Quinn with a buzz*"
"52","19000010","East Island: Snowy Hill","Dungeon Master",">>> *The morning air is bitterly cold as you step out of the cave, but you're prepared for cold weather. The blizzard has passed. A thick, untouched blanket of snow stretches out in every direction. Your breath clouds the air in front of you and your boots sink deep into the fresh powder. The going is slow, every step an effort as the snow drags at your legs.*

*The river beside you winds lazily through the hills, its surface frozen and snowed over. As you follow its course, the land begins to roll, gentle hills rising and falling around you. Here and there, clusters of wind-carved bluffs jut from the snow, their rocky faces slick with ice. The blizzard has buried most landmarks, but the occasional outcrop offers some sense of direction.*

*Snowdrifts pile up against the hillsides, forming smooth, deceptive slopes. With each step, there’s the risk of sinking waist-deep into hidden pockets of powder. The wind, though calmer than the night before, still gusts occasionally, lifting fine sheets of snow into the air.*
(How do you spend your morning hours?)"
"52","19000020","East Island: Snowy Hill","Calabaza","*Cala zips out of the cave, looking around for Quinn. He blinks in the morning sun and tries to alight on the snow, immediately flumping down a good couple of feet with a squeak as the snow is so light and powdery even a ratkin can't be supported*
""YEEP!"""
"52","19000030","East Island: Snowy Hill","Calabaza","*The ratkin-shaped hole tosses up some powder as Cala tries to dig his way out*"
"52","19000040","East Island: Snowy Hill","Quinn","*Quinn laughs to herself to hear her snowball hit and Cala's retort, but as she trudges through, she hears the ratkin's squeal and whips around to see little hands tossing up snow behind her.* ""Hah, hang on!"" *she calls, wading through the snow as fast as she can before she reaches Cala and grabs his hands, pulling him up to air.* ""You gonna be able to walk through this, or do you need a lift?"""
"52","19000050","East Island: Snowy Hill","Darias","*Darias stoop crawls out of the cave... finally stands up and several loud joint pops can be heard echoing.*

""Ahhhh! That's better! I'm glad for the shelter but that was cramped""

*Darias approaches as Quinn offers Cala a lift, and he looks down at both of them compared to the amount of snow...*

""You both might need some help in this snow!"""
"52","19000060","East Island: Snowy Hill","Darias","*Pandora races out flying out of the cave and enjoys the sunshine and staying above the snow.

Darias can feel Cinder wishing to come out and play with the cold snow... Cinder wishes to see the ice crystals melt and then evaporate.*"
"52","19000070","East Island: Snowy Hill","Aillig","*Aillig steps out of the cave, and walks to join the others, using his cane to try and gage the depth of the snow as he goes*"
"52","19000080","East Island: Snowy Hill","Calabaza","*Shivering, Cala clings to Quinn's hand, ears down and fur all wet and looking, well, ratty*
""Yes please...until my wings dry off at least. OOooo so COLD!"""
"52","19000090","East Island: Snowy Hill","Quinn","*Quinn has to restrain her laughter as she keeps Cala above the depths of snow, picking him up to throw him onto her back.* ""Definitely don't want those wings freezing off...though they look pretty neat frosted."""
"52","19000100","East Island: Snowy Hill","Calabaza","*The Ratkin squeaks out a 'Bah!"" but clings to Quinn happily, trying to fit his entire self into her hood to stay warm*
""You should see me during a full moon. You'll wish they were just frosted then."""
"52","19000110","East Island: Snowy Hill","Quinn","*The cat raises a brow, holding onto Cala tightly as they make their way through all the snow.* ""Really? I need to check the lunar phase tonight then, so  I know when to look forward to it."" *She paused.* ""Which makes me curious...does your kind usually have wings?"""
"52","19000120","East Island: Snowy Hill","Calabaza","*Cala's eyes boggle....he should not have said that. His whiskers quiver a little*
""Uh...not really. Then again, there's not really a lot of my kind. Sort of a one-off really"""
"52","19000130","East Island: Snowy Hill","Quinn","""Oh."" *Quinn nods, satisfied with the answer.* ""Well they're a very cool thing to have. I knew a ratkin way back when, he didn't have wings but then again, yours don't always show, right? He could have been hiding them from me."" *She chuckled softly.* ""You're a very neat little guy. Pack a punch too with that crossbow of yours. I thought about using a crossbow instead of a longbow...what made you choose it?"""
"52","19000140","East Island: Snowy Hill","Calabaza","*His mood brightens considerably since this didn't turn into an inquisition and when Quinn says she knew a Ratkin, he is electric with wiggles, climbing all over her. Cue the bombardment of questions!*
""Wh-wh-what? Where? How? Who? Tell me about them! 
As far as I know Ratkins don't have wings, they're normally great hulking ratly brutes. I got these flappers from me Mam, she's of the Fey.
My crossbow? Well I'm small, still growing though! Needed something to fit these paws."""
"52","19000150","East Island: Snowy Hill","Darias","*Darias here's Cala mention something interesting about a full moon...*

*Darias smiles and shakes his head while he quietly says* ""Sneaky mouse! Yet more to learn"""
"52","19000160","East Island: Snowy Hill","Quinn","*Quinn struggles as Cala is struck with excitement and moving around, and she tries to keep her hold on him even as she giggles. She surprised at how open he suddenly is.*  ""Oh, it was years ago! I was part of a sort of alleyway undergroundish group when I was younger and he was passing through. His name was Demitrius, a bard who rode on a donkey named Bartholomew. Loved to write songs, though most of them were playful insults at failed missions. And part Fey you say? Can't say Mitri was part Fey himself but who knows. We all carried secrets."" *She wanted to ask more about Cala's heritage, but didn't want to ruin any of the excitement he currently had.* ""He's off in a city called Thornhedge last I heard."""
"52","19000170","East Island: Snowy Hill","Ra’vek","*Ra’vek walks alongside Aillig for a while.*

**”Hey friend - how are you holding up? That mountain pass still looks pretty far away.  I bet we’ll have at least one more night in this dreadfully cold weather.”**"
"52","19000180","East Island: Snowy Hill","Aillig","*Aillig continues walking for a long few moments before responding,* ""Well, the cold certainly isn't the most pleasant thing, but being better equipped makes it a good deal more tolerable. I do feel somewhat... weighed down. But, I think it not from the weather. There is something about the seed..."" *He shakes his head* ""I don't know, like it is still a presence even thought the lead case. Maybe its just my mind playing tricks on me, looking to the shoe to drop..."""
"52","19000190","East Island: Snowy Hill","Ra’vek","**”Hmm… I hope that’s not the case.  I suppose we could take turns carrying it if you want.  No need for burdening you with it all.”**

"52","19000210","East Island: Snowy Hill","Aillig","*Aillig shakes his head.* “I think there is a sort of puzzle to solve to open it and I haven’t had a good length of time to properly work at it. I did manage to prepare a set of lenses that may help with the process though. Perhaps when we get a chance to rest some place where we can actually feel our fingers I can give it a proper examination.”"
"52","19000220","East Island: Snowy Hill","Ra’vek","**”Most interesting.  I’d be curious to see you work.  You have a clear talent… and level of patience that I don’t pretend to have.  I’m sure you’ll figure it out.”**

"52","19000230","East Island: Snowy Hill","Dungeon Master",">>> *By mid-day the sky has brightened further and the temperature rises just enough to make the snow dense and clinging. Occasionally, the distant groan of shifting ice echoes across the valley.*"
"52","19000240","East Island: Snowy Hill","Darias","*As the group pauses and enjoys the sun, feeling at least a little warmer. Darias casts Bonfire many times... to give everyone a chance to warm themselves.*

"52","19000250","East Island: Snowy Hill","Aillig","*Smiling, Aillig nods* “It is nice to be able to spread the strain of casting a bit, and to work with another with affinity for similar magics.”"
"52","19000260","East Island: Snowy Hill","Dungeon Master",">>> *After warming by the fire, Darias confidentially leads the way with Quinn and Cala in close tow. Aillig and Ra’vek continue their discussions farther back.*

*It’s early afternoon now and the landscape begins to shift; wide, rolling hills give way to boulder fields as the elevation increases slightly faster. The snow-covered river banks periodically hosts rocky outcroppings as the river snakes back and forth.*

*After another hour of travel, the river begins to carve a narrow gorge through the frozen earth. The walls rise gradually at first, but soon steepen into taller cliffs slick with ice and packed snow.*

*The air grows still in this sheltered space as the wind whispers above. The sun is at its highest here and you all loosen your winter clothing up a bit.*"
"52","19000270","East Island: Snowy Hill","Darias","*Darias smiles and nods back to Aillig.*

“Aye, our magics have similarities but they are not the same. i’ve seen you create magic from… what do you call them? Siguuls?

it’s not something i’m familiar with, but it’s very powerful and useful.”"

*… until there’s a sound.  Thee sound.*

*The low, rasping croak of a raven echoes through the gorge, reverberating off the ice walls. Ra’vek’s Nevermore Talon has spoken. The now too familiar chill races up your spine. Muscles tense, hands drift toward weapons, and everyone holds their breath for a brief second to listen…*

 *Everyone, that is… EXCEPT Darias. He doesn’t notice a thing. He’s halfway through a story about burning down something out of balance, while gesturing wildly and being generally oblivious to anything but his own words.*

*Up ahead, Quinn’s gaze sharpens instantly. Her eyes flick to the path ahead - and there it is! A massive elk, half-buried in the snow, its lifeless body sprawled unnaturally in the center of the gorge.*

*Steam still rises from the fresh wounds torn through its hide. Her stomach tightens. **Something big killed it. And it’s still here**.*

*Before she can speak, movement draws her eye - a flicker of white against white. A hand. A massive hand. Thick with matted, white fur it emerges from behind a jagged outcrop of ice. It reaches down and tears a rib straight from the elk’s carcass with a wet, crunching snap.*

*The hand vanishes behind the rock again. A deep, guttural breath rumbles through the gorge. Whatever it is, it hasn’t seen you… yet.*

As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphere's damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.

When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet."

his face … 



his lips …

Fumbling over her thoughts, she was about to ask if there was any way she could help, but he wouldn't be able to respond anyways, nor would she be able to get those stitches off. Were spectrals able to write, or even pick up objects? Maybe he could write in the snow?* ""I'm so sorry,"" *she told him quietly.* ""Can you write at all about what happened to you? How we can help?"" *She doubted there was much she could do, and Cala's earlier words whispered in the back of her mind, dulling her just slightly and making her regret saying 'we'.

*As the wind settles, the firbolg’s form stabilizes, though it remains frail and flickering. There is hesitation… and then slowly he lifts two trembling fingers to his sealed lips. He presses in and pulls on the stitches painfully. His eyes squeeze shut at the sensation. A low, mournful gasp shudders through him. His fingers drift downward, resting over his heart. He looks briefly at you. His eyes, filled with a deep and quiet sorrow, silently begging to be understood.*

*It is only then, after another long pause, that he reaches out, not towards you, but toward the snow on the edge of the gate. His hand hovers there for a moment. Then, with slow, deliberate strokes, the firbolg priest  begins to draw with spectral fingers.*

*It’s hard to make out what it is at first.  A large rectangle… then smaller squares within… he gestures up the mountain.  You soon realize, it’s a crude map sketched into the snow.*"

*Another gust of wind blows… his form flickers once again… and then he’s gone!  10… 20… 30 seconds later he flickers back in.  With a renewed sense of urgency he walks to the large stone wall and gestures to it, then to his eyes, then to the wall, and back again to the Xed square in the snow.*

*He pauses, clearly hoping you understand.  He then repeats this process, but for another, larger, square, to the right of the first. This time he takes both hands and raises them towards his mouth then places them palms down, flexing his fingers as if grasping something.  He repeats this several times - hands up to mimic speaking, then palms down grasping.*

Quinn chews on her lip and writes down what motions the male did as well, thinking about all he shared. She was never that great at riddles nor puzzles...and this seemed close to one. Was his initial gesture with the walls and the eye telling her that that square meant the one x'ed on the map? Or was that further up the mountain and this would help when they traveled further? The grasping and speaking motions left her just as confused and she stared at her paper then at the snow, her head buzzing.

- The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
- Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
- The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
- A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.,
Note:The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.

You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time.

Creating an _experimental elixir_ requires you to have alchemist's supplies on your person, and any elixir you create with this feature lasts until it is drunk or until the end of your next long rest.
