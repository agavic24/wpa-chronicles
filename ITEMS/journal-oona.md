# Oona the Lost Journal
## Early Entries
The battles continue.  I strive to help the faithful, but so many are lost.
The forest is losing to venom.  Forest turns to swamp.   Old trees rot from within, and the waters grow thick with strange blooms. I will not give up. Life will reclaim that which was lost!
So many years.  100?  200?  There is no balance here.
I miss him.  I miss him every day.  I hate them.  If only I had been stronger…
The Tree of Souls has sent a seed, a gift from the gods!  This must restore the balance of our forest.  Our king has entrusted me with its safekeeping.  It is an honor beyond words and I will not fail.

## Mid Entries
The others have left, but I cannot abandon our home. I will heal this land, even if I must do it alone.
The forest still bears many scars. No matter how much I nurture the land, something is wrong. Perhaps the seed can mend what I cannot.
I dreamed of him last night—his laughter, his warmth. I awoke with the decision made. I will plant the seed where he fell.
I felt the magic stir as I placed the seed in the soil. Something ancient still lingers beneath the roots, but I will guide it toward life, not ruin.

## Late Entries
The seed grows faster than I expected, twisting in ways I do not understand. It speaks to me—not in words, but in whispers I feel in my bones.
I held it in my hands today. It is… magnificent. I think it knows me. Strangely comforting.
The trees are responding to the seed’s presence, twisting, reaching. I hear their voices clearer than ever before. Perhaps this is the gift I was meant to receive.
The Sporion talks to me.  I know its name.  It has shown me the truth. The elves were weak to abandon this place. I alone will make it strong again.
Why did I ever weep for him? He is part of the forest now, as all things should be. Flesh is weak, fleeting, imperfect—only the rooted ones endure. I see that clearly now.
Final Entry
The Sporion and I are one. The forest will rise again, shaped by our will. No outsiders will take it from us. No one.
