# Embers of the Old Growth
A historical and philosophical text detailing the beliefs, practices, and recorded deeds of the Circle of the Wildfire.

## The Flickering Path
To walk the path of Wildfire is to embrace the paradox of flame: it devours, yet nourishes; it reduces to ash, yet clears the way for renewal. The Druids of this Circle are both feared and revered, for they do not merely tend to nature—they challenge it, provoke it, and sometimes, burn away what stands in its way.

## The Emerging Wildfire
Long ago, within the great Druidic conclaves, a divide formed. Traditionalists sought to preserve the wilds as they were, standing as guardians against unnatural change. Yet among them rose a faction who saw danger in unchecked preservation, believing that stagnation led to decay. They looked to the wildfire—nature’s own hand upon the land—as a guide. From this division, the Circle of the Wildfire emerged, breaking from their kin to walk a more volatile path.

## Fire as a Teacher
The Circle of the Wildfire teaches that destruction and creation are not opposites, but reflections of one another. Fire does not discriminate—it consumes the old and sickly, making way for the young and strong. These Druids see themselves as caretakers of this cycle, wielding flame as both a scythe and a seed.
Among their core tenets:
- The Cycle Must Turn: Death feeds life, and fire is a herald of change.
- Burn with Purpose: Fire without restraint is ruin, but fire without courage is stagnation.
- Ashes Hold Secrets: From the remains of the past, wisdom and renewal rise.

## Deeds of the Flamewalkers
Across history, the Circle’s interventions have been met with awe and horror alike. They have set controlled burns in dying forests to prevent greater wildfires, cleansed blighted lands with purging flame, and even laid waste to settlements whose greed defied the balance of nature. Legends tell of the Burning Pact of Eldenwode, where Wildfire Druids incinerated an entire grove infected with a creeping blight that no other magic could halt. In contrast, the Ashen Reckoning speaks of those who lost themselves to the fire’s call, leaving only ruin in their wake.

## The Perils of the Path
Not all who walk the Wildfire path do so wisely. Fire is a seductive force, and history remembers those who became zealots, who burned not for renewal but for the sheer exaltation of destruction. Their names are whispered as warnings—embers of caution against the ever-hungry flame.

## The Waning Flame
As civilizations grew and the fear of fire’s power spread, the Circle found itself hunted, misunderstood, and often outlawed. Many of its members were forced into secrecy, their practices deemed too dangerous for a world that sought stability over transformation. Yet the Wildfire never truly dies—embers smolder beneath the surface, waiting for the breath of renewal. The Circle still exists, hidden in the forgotten places, where those who seek to understand fire’s true nature may yet find their path.

## To Those Who Would Kindle the Flame
To embrace Wildfire is to accept that nothing is permanent—not the forest, not the mountain, not even oneself. Yet in destruction, there is always the seed of what comes next. For those who would learn, the flame is patient. But remember: fire is never tamed, only respected.

May your path be alight with wisdom, and may your flames leave behind more than ashes.
