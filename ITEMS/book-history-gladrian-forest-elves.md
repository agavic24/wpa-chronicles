# History of the Galadrian Forest Elves
The Galadrian Forest is a place of legend, its towering silver-barked trees whispering the secrets of ages past. Its story begins many millennia ago, when a family of elves, weary from their travels, discovered the verdant expanse nestled on the southern edge of the island. Led by the wise and noble elder Galadrian Sylva'thalion, they made their home within the ancient woodlands, drawn by its serene beauty and the potent magic that coursed through the land. In time, they named it after their leader, and so it became The Galadrian Forest.

## The Formation of the Circle of the Verdant Veil
As generations passed, the elves flourished, attuning themselves to the rhythms of the land. From among them arose an order of moon druids, dedicated to the preservation and harmony of the forest. Calling themselves the Circle of the Verdant Veil, these guardians became stewards of the sacred groves, protectors of the wild creatures, and keepers of the arcane mysteries hidden within the trees.
The druids uncovered a truth that set Galadrian apart from any other forest: beneath its roots, ancient ley lines intersected, creating a powerful nexus point. This wellspring of arcane energy imbued the land with extraordinary vitality but also made it a beacon for those who sought power.

## The Arrival of Venom
It was this energy that eventually drew the attention of a malevolent force—the ancient green dragon known as Venom. A being of great cunning and terrible might, Venom sought to twist the ley lines to his own ends, siphoning their magic to enhance his already formidable power. The Circle of the Verdant Veil recognized the danger he posed and vowed to resist him at any cost.

## The War for Galadrian
Thus began a war that spanned centuries. Venom’s minions—a legion of twisted creatures, corrupted beasts, and dark sorcerers—clashed against the druidic elves, whose deep connection to nature granted them potent magic of their own. The battles scarred the land, shaking the great trees and poisoning the once-pristine rivers.
But Venom’s power was insidious. He claimed a lair in the heart of the swamp and tapped into the ley lines, tainting its once-pure energy. He seeped his own toxic breath into the waters and a vile plague spread across the southern reaches of the island, warping flora and fauna into abominations. The corruption coalesced into a festering swamp where no life could thrive. Even as the druids fought valiantly, they were slowly pushed back. The balance the druids had fought so hard to maintain was crumbling.

## The Seed from the Tree of Souls
Desperation gave birth to a final gambit. The druids convened in their most sacred grove at the nexus point within their capital city, Mythalas. Through an ancient ritual, they summoned a miraculous seed from the Tree of Souls – an artifact of immeasurable power, said to be capable of restoring the forest even in the wake of utter devastation.
Yet their hopes were dashed. Venom’s corruption was relentless, and the war was lost. Some say they should have tried more radical ideas, but it was too late.  The remaining elves, recognizing their dwindling numbers and the impossibility of victory, made the heart-wrenching decision to flee. They would take the seed with them, safeguarding it until the day they could return and fulfill the ritual.

## The Betrayal and the Exodus
On the eve of their departure, tragedy struck. The seed was stolen.
Oona Moonshadow, a gifted druidess consumed by grief over her brother’s death in battle, betrayed her kin. Blaming the leaders for their failure, she took the sacred seed and vanished into the depths of the corrupted forest. Some say she sought vengeance, intending to use the seed for her own ends. Others whisper that she hoped to restore the land by herself, believing the elders had been too hesitant.
A desperate search ensued, but with dwindling resources and no clear path forward, the elves had no choice but to abandon their homeland. They vowed to return one day, to reclaim their sacred woods, to find Oona, and to restore that which was lost.

Where the elves of the Galadrian Forest went, none can say.
