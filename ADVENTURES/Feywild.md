# Feywild Character Arc Scenarios

These scenarios for intertwining Mina's coming-of-age journey, Ra's pact dilemma, and Cala's quest to reclaim his past. Each scenario approaches the connections differently while hitting all key character beats.



### Mina's Arc
**The Call:** Mina receives an urgent summons from her mother Lethanyra. An arranged marriage has been proposed to a minor fey noble's son, meant to secure the family's standing and "tame" Mina's wild nature. The wedding date is set for the next full moon, giving Mina only weeks to fulfill her personal journey.  The moonstone dragon, Velisar Moonrock, will fill Mina in on Silisk's slow transformation into a dream walker is accelerating and a potential cure for her father - but time is running it out.  A ritual must be completed before the next full moon before he's permanently lost.

**The Journey:** Mina must travel to the Stone Giant ancestral halls (her father's lineage) to retrieve a sacred stone that will ground him back. This journey represents her exploration of her father's heritage and her own dual nature.

**The Revelation:** At the climax, when Mina retrieves the sacred stone, saving her father.  She then faces the arranged marriage. Velisar appears. He tells her that the moondragon pact isn't about duty - it's about choice. The ancestors she channels through her rage aren't obligations; they're her own strength made manifest. Mina realizes her mother's fear - driven marriage arrangement is the opposite of what the moondragons actually want: a guardian who chooses service out of love, not obligation.

**Resolution:** Mina refuses the marriage, confronts her mother about trust and freedom, and fully accepts her role as guardian - not because it's her duty, but because it's who she is. She also helps guide her father back to the stone halls underground to be "where he belongs".



### Ra's Arc
**The Summons:** The Maiden of the Moon calls upon Ra through Klymok, she has a traitor to hunt down.  Ra eventually traitor is Cala's father.

**The Choice:** The Maiden demands Ra execute Bram as restitution for his crime. However, Ra has come to care for Cala, and killing his father would destroy their friendship and violate everything Ra has built with the party. This is Ra's ultimate test: choose the pact or choose the party.

**The Twist:** The Maiden reveals that the ambush was actually orchestrated by King Bronnor of Harrowhame. Cala's father was manipulated into leading the kidnappers (who were Bronnor's agents) into that glade, making him an unwitting pawn. The Maiden offers an alternative: if Ra can rescue the 3 patrol members that were captured and taken to Harrowhame, the debt will be considered paid.

**Resolution:** Ra successfully helps thwart Bronnor's plot with the party's help. The Maiden, impressed by Ra's ability to find a solution that honors both the pact and their conscience, offers Ra a greater role in the Gloaming Court - but also the freedom to interpret their duties more broadly. Ra learns they can serve without losing themselves.



### Cala's Arc
**The Found Father:** Somehow Cala learns of her father's location.  This ends up in the ears of the Maiden of the Moon as well, as she's been looking for him. The Maiden calls upon Ra.

**The Discovery:** Through Ra's pact calling, Cala learns his father, Bram, was a guide who helped folks with safe passage across the Brokenstone Vale. He new everything in the Vale, include the patrols that the Maiden of the Moon conducted.  One night, Cala was kidnapped by the King Bronnor's men to be used as a pawn to get to the Maiden of the Moon, whom Bronnor wanted slain.  Bram was blackedmailed into setting up an ambush that should have included the Maiden, but she wasn't in the patrol party that night (lucky change of plans for her).  The ambush was still successful for the minions as 2 were killed and 3 more were captured, never to be seen from again. Bram was knocked out in the battle (assumed dead) and when he awoke his son was gone.

**The Journey to Mug Tureah:** Cala must return to Mug Tureah (deep in the Feydark) to clear his father's name and bring back the prisoners.  He will also retrieve his stolen memories that Mother Snæbjörg extracted and stored in porceline dolls.

**The Reunion:** After rescuing the memories and other captives, Cala is reunited with his parents at Shatterstone. His father was devastated by guilt and shame over being used by Bronnor. Cala learns his father was never evil - he was a good man caught in a web of fey politics and manipulation. The reunion is bittersweet but healing.

**Resolution:** Cala's memories return, revealing he was training to be a scout and guide like his father. He experiences his first full moon transformation in the Feywild, fully becoming a wererat for the first time. He reconciles both sides of his heritage, accepting that he doesn't need to choose between ratkin and fey—he's both.
