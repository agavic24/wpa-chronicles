## Merriwig Fiddlecap Teahouse

Kaleidoscope Cap Infusion - Creates a classic hallucinogenic mushroom trip.

Dreamers Eye - When consumed, your eyes take on a faint bioluminescent glow. For 1 hour, you gain blindsight out to 30 feet and can see invisible creatures within that range. Additionally, you have advantage on Perception checks that rely on sight in darkness or dim light.
