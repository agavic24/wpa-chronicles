“Ok… here we go.  This has my notes from back when I last saw him.  It says you’ll want to start at the forest’s edge and follow the blue-capped mushrooms - not the red-capped ones! Those lead to trouble from what I wrote down.”

He continues reading with mild amusement, and once again finding some clarity and comfort with a book in his hand.

“Now, here’s the tricky bit. Merriwig’s place is hidden by a secret entrance. It won’t be obvious. Keep an eye out for a perfect ring of mushrooms similar to the other blue-caps, but these will have white spots dotting their bright azure tops. Step inside the ring and say - ‘A door for friends is never closed’. You should see a stairwell leading down to the tea house.”
