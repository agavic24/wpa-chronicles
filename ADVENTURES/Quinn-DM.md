> Quinn and Marz have now slipped through the crowd and out of sight.

Once out of earshot and down the alley, Quinn turns to Marz with furrowed brows. "What are you doing here, Marz?" she asks, folding her arms. She's still unsure of how to feel about this whole situation, especially after the events of recent, but is willing to hear the goblin out, for now. He was in some sort of scuffle which meant it was unlikely he had strayed far from the path they both used to roam. "What sorts of things are you getting into? You could have been pummeled back there!" She gestures out back towards her party.

>>> *Now that you're alone you take in a long look at Marz.  His shoulders are slumped and dark circles of exhaustion are under his eyes.  Even in the relative safety of the alley, he's scanning the shadows and rooftops with practiced paranoia. His hands, still clutching that jingling purse of gems, tremble just slightly before he shoves it into a hidden pocket.*

*When he finally meets your eyes and tries to explain...*

**"I know what you're thinking. I'm not on a job. I didn't know you'd be here. I didn't... I never meant to..."**

*He runs a hand through his hair... trying to relax.*

**"That night. Long ago... I should have been there. We both should have been."**

*A focus comes back in his eyes.*

 **"I've looking for him, Quinn. I'm going to find him! Makolo. It's been almost two years now... following every lead, every whisper. I've tracked him across two continents... always one step behind. I'm close now though. I know I am. There's a someone here... in this outpost.  Someone who moves exotic... merchandise.  This could be the lead I need. He must be close!"**

*The goblin, once your old friend, now stands silent, waiting his judgment.*

Quinn watches Marz carefully. His behavior, his mannerisms, all the same from years past. He hadn't changed much thus far. As he continues though, and he speaks the name of their long lost friend, every muscle in her body seizes. A small bit of panic flashes through her, and she does her best not to show it. She bites her tongue, waiting for him to finish. She didn't believe it. Not for a moment could she imagine that all this time, -he- was looking for Makolo while she was not. Well, that wasn't the entire truth. But she didn't know if that was knowledge she should be so open about so soon.

"What kinds of leads?" she inquired. "Who have you been following to get this information? Is it even trustworthy? Two years is a long time to keep moving 'merchandise'. I wouldn't be so certain he's..." Her gaze shifted, avoiding his, before letting out a huffed breath. "What do you know?"

>>> *Marz's jaw tightens, defensive. His eyes flicker away for just a moment before snapping back.*

**"Merchants' ledgers. Slaver routes. Port manifests. I've got contacts in half a dozen cities - people who know things, who see things. This collector? That's recent. I heard there was someone out in the outpost when I arrived in the city. Apparently they know most of what runs through the grey market."**

*He pauses, his voice dropping lower.*

**"And I know he's alive, Quinn. I've seen the records. Just 3 months back someone paid for a 'singing tortle' to be kept... comfortable and brought here - to NLP. That's Makolo. It has to be!"**

Quinn still was uncertain about all of this information. It was a little too convenient for her past to catch up to her now, in a random city, along with another person she knew that he apparently had a connection with. The thought of Makolo being alive, being -here-... Her gut tightened in an almost painful way. Her gaze went to the alley side they entered from, hearing the distant voices of her party, her friends. At least, she hoped they considered her to be one. If they knew what she had done, knew the origin of her precious dice set, they could very well throw her into the dirt and she wouldn't be able to argue.

"Okay...say he's alive. He's here, somewhere, kept away. What do we do about it? We can't walk into some night market deal and get our heads cut off." Not to mention wanting to avoid a certain type in those markets in the first place. "Gods know we can't afford to outbid whoever bought him either."

>>> *Marz's hands clenching into fists and grinds his teeth as he painfully explains...*

**"Cedric. He owed me. He had a sigil. From his guild. Powerful enough to buy Makolo's freedom outright. But now..."**

*He gestures sharply toward the market, his voice tight with barely contained his rage.*

**"That's why I... that's why I lost it back there. Cedric was essential. And now... now he and his damn sigil are gone! Off that F*CKING MOUNTAIN!!**

*He takes a sharp breath... slowly forcing himself to calm back down...*

**"I don't know how yet, Quinn. But I'll find another way. I have to."**

The cat flinched at his roar, ears and whiskers pinning back. She understood the pain. Maybe not completely, but knowing that was the one avenue, and it was ripped from his hands...she empathized in some small part of herself. But it did leave them a bit hopeless now. She mulled on his words, on the situation at hand. She was never the one who made the plans. Only the avenues to make them happen...if that.

"I think at the very least, if we can keep him here, then we can stall while we figure out something. I doubt there's anything that rivals the cost if a guild sigil would cover it, but at least it can prevent him from moving further away." Her eyes met Marz's again. "What is your next plan, then? For what you're going to do in the meantime?"

>>> **"We need to find this agent. This collector."**

*A slow smile dares to creep back onto his face...*

**"And I know exactly where to start. And you do too. It's in the pubs with dice and ale, where loose tongues wag and we prevail!"**

*His eyes light up with an old look you haven't seen in years... sharp, clever, ready for anything.*

**"I hear there's a tavern called The Salty Pig around here somewhere."**

*He gestures toward the sounds of the outpost beyond the alley. The rage and exhaustion seeming to lift from his shoulders as he gives you a grin.*

**"What do you say? One more roll of the dice... for old times' sake? For Makolo?"**
