# Intro to Verdant Outpost.

    ## Approaching Verdant Outpost
    After several short breaks and miles and miles of hiking, you crest the final hill and the Verdant Outpost comes into view.
    
    What began as a simple fort has blossomed into a thriving settlement that rivals the City of Lights itself. Sturdy stone walls rise from the landscape, their watchtowers standing sentinel over the surrounding countryside. Beyond the walls, acres of farmland stretch out in organized rows, crisscrossed by low stone barriers and patrolled by guards on raised posts. Well-worn roads and deep wagon ruts converge at the edge of town, marking this as a hub of constant trade and travel. Caravans move along these paths like arteries, bringing life and commerce to this frontier settlement.
    
    The air carries the mingled scents of wildflowers, tilled earth, and the faint, inviting warmth of hot springs that drift from within the walls.

    After another half hour, you pass through the gates and the true character of Verdant Outpost reveals itself.
    
    The original fort still stands at the heart of the settlement, its warm halls housing the famous hot springs and baths that first drew travelers here. Around it a bustling village has grown, creating a vibrant community.
    
    A keep rises beside the original fort, housing the outpost governor. The settlement hums with activity: merchants haggling over goods, farmers discussing the latest harvest.  And near the center, a brilliant blue aetheryte rotates slowly, its magical energy pulsing with the promise of instant travel.
    
    Despite the organized chaos, there's an undeniable sense of safety and comfort here.

# Mina Reintroduction.
    After returning to the bustle of the City of Lights from the Calamari Cove Outpost, Mina headed to the Borealis to unwind. While there she crossed paths with Marz, a sharp-tongued goblin, and Cedric, his rough-edged human companion.
    The two were looking for a guide to the Verdant Outpost. Marz never explained why they were heading west - only that they wanted to leave ASAP.  Despite some hesitation on Mina’s part, the trio eventually struck a deal. Mina would be paid in two red rubies (each 100GP), one paid up front and another upon arrival.
    The journey, however, turned grim. Midway through the pass, when a pair of young manticores swooped down from the cliffs, the narrow trail erupted into chaos. Mina held the line while Cedric, pressed back by a diving swipe, lost his footing on the crumbling edge. With a yell, Cedric slipped, tumbling to his death hundreds of feet below.
    Now, at the Verdant Outpost, both are furious.  Marz accused Mina of leading them onto a dangerous route and losing both his friend and the gems.  While Cedric's fate was unfortunate, Mina isn’t buying Marz's excuse of non-payment. She's seen him shaking a purse of jewels.  This little thief can definitely pay, but is clearly holding back.
    On a better day, Mina might have just walked away.  Mina doesn't care all that much for monetarily valuable things.  She's less upset about the lack of payment itself and more about the lack of honesty and her own inability to save the poor guy. 
    But then Cedric starts hurly insults.  Mina has zero tolerance for slandering her bloodline or her honer. She's starting to rage with fury and is close to smacking this wily goblin back onto the mountain pass they came from.

# Marz Past since leaving Quinn
    Marz is looking for their friend, Makolo. He has spent years following breadcrumbs - a merchant's ledger here, a slaver's route there. He tracked Makolo across two continents, always one port behind. The trail led him to this new continent.   He heard rumors of a "collector" who moves exotic "merchandise" through this very outpost.

# Market scene.
    
    *As you round the corner into the market square, you smell the **mingled aromas** of the market - fresh bread, roasted meats, herbs, and yes, something wonderfully spicy from a nearby stall.*
        
    *But it's **not Cala**, heads down and focused on tracking the scent of something truly spicy, that catches your attention.*
        
    *A crowd has formed a wide circle, merchants hastily pulling their carts back, and vendors abandoning their stalls. At the center stand **two figures** locked in a tense standoff.*
        
    *Towering over the chaos, a 7-foot frame **goliath** stands strong, barely containing her fury. Her **pink hair with a chromatic feather** whips around elk-like horns as she moves. A colossal glaive is still strapped to her back, but her hands are clenched into fists the size of small boulders. Spectral butterflies, usually playful, now dart erratically around her horns like agitated spirits sensing their host's rage.*
        
    *Across from her, a **wiry goblin** stands his ground, though his bravado looks thin. He's gesturing wildly with one hand while the other clutches a small leather purse that jingles with what sounds like gems. His voice cuts through the market noise, sharp and accusatory.*
        
    **"...and you call yourself a guide? You led us straight into those manticores! Cedric's dead because of your incompetence, you oversized..."**
        
    *The goliath's voice booms back...*

    Mina: "Finish that sentence I dare you and you'll have the full might and fury of the Delhin lineage written into your bones! I will not be accused falsely you half sized cowardly excuse of a person when I damn near lost my own life just getting you out of there! SO HOLD UP YOUR PART OR SO BE IT ILL MAKE YOU FORGET WHAT DECADE IT IS!" 

    This is a rather unnatural state for the woman to be in. But circumstances as they were had pulled her normally very focused fury to the surface in a spectacular display. She held herself from a brawl on a spider silk thread of self control swiftly unraveling….
    
    The crowd murmurs nervously. Some onlookers edge backward, while others crane their necks for a better view. A few guards have noticed the commotion and are pushing through the crowd, but they're still several moments away.

    Mina's eyes narrow as she snatches the ruby and pockets it swiftly.

    "Square. Now off with you. Hope I never catch you on a bad day again. Go grieve in peace." 

    When her attention finally catches on a familiar face (Quinn) her eyes widen substantially and she turns on a heel.

    "Oh by the wilds I- s-so sorry friend! I didn't uh, mean to be caught like this." 

    Her face starts to go as pink as her hair.

    Marz starts to slowly step backwards, hoping to slink to the shadows and away from all the prying eyes.

    But he stops immediately as he follows the barbarians eye sight... to Quinn.

    His jaw drops...

    The guards finally push through the edge of the crowd, their hands on their weapons and expressions stern. But before they can reach the center of the commotion, **Aillig** steps forward, raising a hand in a calm, authoritative gesture that would have served him well in his days as a sigil agent.

    "Simply a misunderstanding that has been resolved through the magic of civil conversation, my good fellows. Nothing worth troubling you all to take time from your busy days."

    His voice carries the practiced cadence of someone who has mediated countless disputes. The lead guard, a weathered human with a scar across his brow, pauses and studies the scene. The tension has clearly defused—Mina is now turned away from Marz, her attention on Quinn, and the goblin seems frozen in place rather than continuing his tirade. The crowd, while still watching, has lost that edge of imminent violence.

    The guard's hand relaxes on his sword hilt. He gives Aillig a measured nod.

    "Right then. Keep it civil, all of you. We've got enough real trouble to deal with without market brawls."

    With a final sweeping glance, the guards turn and begin dispersing the lingering onlookers, their presence enough to encourage merchants to return to their stalls and the normal rhythm of the market to resume.

    As the guards move away, Marz remains frozen, his eyes locked on Quinn with an expression that's equal parts recognition and something else—fear? Guilt? His mouth works silently for a moment, his sharp features contorting through a rapid series of emotions: shock, shame, and then something that might be desperate hope.

    As the guards moved in, Marz remained frozen... ready to flee in a moment.

    But now that there will be no trouble, his eyes lock back on Quinn. His mouth works silently for a moment before he rushes in, right past Mina, face-to-face with Quinn.

    "Quinn?? Quinn!! Is it really you?!"

    Quinn is relieved to see Mina in one piece, and after the guards being sent off with a dismissal from Aillig, she's suddenly face to face with Marz. She laughs, albeit a bit out of surprise, taking a step back though not out of discomfort. "Yeah, yeah, it's me...I can't believe it's you," she breathes out. Should she hug him? Punch him? Awkwardly rock on her heels? She never expected to see him again and yet... "You're still causing trouble, huh?"

    Mina steps back away from the now not retreating goblin so that she can better contain her emotions. She's still unhappy, even if the payment is settled, fury a latent heat under her skin. She does not try to interject or cause problems in the reunion though as she contemplates just how much forgiveness the rubies will buy her once she goes back...

    **"Ah!  Of course it's you. Just when I..."**

    *He cuts himself off, one hand still clutching the jingling purse of gems, the other gesturing vaguely at the space between them.*

    **"Look, I know what you're probably thinking. I know how this looks."**

    *His eyes dart around the market, checking for watchers, for anyone who might be listening. His attention keeps snapping back to Quinn, as if he can't quite believe she's here.*

    **"I didn't... I mean... I tried to find you."** *He's clearly strugging to find the words...*

    **"After... after what happened. Makolo..."**

    *His voice cracks slightly on the name... he swallows hard.*

    *The sharp-tongued goblin, who moments ago was hurling accusations at a seven-foot barbarian, now looks very small...*

    **"Can we go somewhere to talk?"**
