# Outpost Tavern: Post-Journey Activities

## The Rusty Anchor Tavern

A weathered outpost tavern that serves as a crossroads for travelers, traders, and adventurers. The building is made of rough-hewn timber with a stone fireplace dominating the common room. The air smells of woodsmoke, ale, and roasted meat. A large antler chandelier hangs from the ceiling, casting warm, flickering light across the room.

## Character-Specific Activities & Opportunities

### **Mina'Khor Delhin** - The Jovial Giant

**What She'd Enjoy:**
- **The Strength Challenge**: A massive stone anvil sits in the corner with a sign: "Lift it overhead, win a free round for the house!" The anvil weighs 800 lbs. and has been there for 20 years, untouched.
- **The Beast Tamer's Tale**: A grizzled ranger with a tame dire wolf pup is telling stories. The pup is skittish around large crowds but seems curious about Mina's fey-giant presence.
- **The Forge's Warmth**: The tavern has a small forge in the back (used for repairs). The smith is working late, and the rhythmic clanging reminds Mina of home. She could offer to help or share techniques.

**RP Opportunities:**
- **Animal Handling Check (DC 12)**: The dire wolf pup approaches Mina cautiously. Success: The pup nuzzles her hand, and the ranger shares a story about fey-giant encounters. Failure: The pup growls, but Mina can still engage the ranger.
- **Athletics Check (DC 20)**: Lift the anvil. Success: The entire tavern erupts in cheers, free drinks for everyone, and Mina becomes a local legend. Failure: She strains but can't quite lift it—still earns respect and a free meal.
- **Nature Check (DC 14)**: Recognize the ranger's gear as Feywild-made. Opens conversation about her homeland and potential information about the fey crossing.

**Potential Rewards:**
- Information about the fey crossing location
- A small ruby (her mother likes rubies) from a grateful patron
- A challenge from a local strongman who wants to test his mettle

### **Aillig McCaird** - The Contract Keeper

**What He'd Enjoy:**
- **The Scholar's Corner**: A quiet alcove with a bookshelf containing old ledgers, maps, and a few arcane texts. A half-elf scholar is studying a contract written in Celestial.
- **The Puzzle Box**: The tavern keeper has a strange mechanical puzzle box that's been unsolved for months. It's clearly artificer-made, with intricate runes and gears.
- **The Sigil Wall**: A wall covered in carved sigils and symbols from various contracts and agreements. Some are faded, some are fresh.

**RP Opportunities:**
- **Investigation Check (DC 16)**: Examine the puzzle box. Success: Aillig recognizes it as a sigil agent's lockbox. Inside: a contract fragment mentioning a "Guardianship Pact" (related to Mina's moondragons?). Failure: He can't solve it, but notices it's similar to his own Lockbox of Holding.
- **Arcana Check (DC 15)**: Decipher the Celestial contract. Success: It's a trade agreement with a clause about "fey crossings" and "guardian services." Failure: He recognizes the language but needs more time.
- **History Check (DC 13)**: Recognize some sigils on the wall as belonging to known fey contracts. Opens conversation about contract enforcement in the region.

**Potential Rewards:**
- Information about the moondragon pact (if he connects the dots)
- A lead on magical tattoo materials
- An invitation to examine more contracts at a nearby trading post

**What He'd Enjoy:**
- **The Fire Pit**: A large fire pit in the center of the tavern where travelers share stories. Darias could contribute tales of balance and cleansing fire.
- **The Bard's Stage**: A small stage where a traveling bard is performing. The bard's lute has fire-themed songs, and they're looking for someone to harmonize.
- **The Smoking Contest**: Locals are competing to see who can create the most interesting smoke patterns using different herbs and tinder.

**RP Opportunities:**
- **Performance Check (DC 14)**: Join the bard in a fire-themed song or story. Success: The crowd is mesmerized, and Darias gains temporary inspiration. Failure: The performance is awkward, but the bard appreciates the effort and shares a story about wildfire spirits.
- **Persuasion Check (DC 12)**: Convince the tavern keeper to let him demonstrate a controlled fire trick (using his wildfire spirit). Success: Impresses the crowd, earns free drinks. Failure: The keeper is cautious but allows it with supervision.
- **Insight Check (DC 15)**: Notice someone in the crowd is watching him intently—they have a symbol of the Wildfire Circle. Could be a contact or a test.

**Potential Rewards:**
- Information about other Wildfire Circle members in the region
- A rare herb that enhances fire magic
- A connection to someone who knows about Master Karrig

### **Quinn** - The Gambling Cat

**What She'd Enjoy:**
- **The Dice Tables**: Multiple gaming tables with various dice games in progress. A high-stakes game of Liar's Dice is happening in the corner.
- **The Card Sharp**: A well-dressed halfling is running a card game. They're clearly skilled, but Quinn might spot their tells.
- **The Dart Board**: A dart board with a betting pool. The current champion is a surly dwarf who's been winning all night.

**RP Opportunities:**
- **Perception Check (DC 16)**: Watch the card game and spot the halfling's tells (finger twitch when bluffing, slight breath change). Success: Quinn can join and has advantage on her first Deception check. Failure: She notices something's off but can't pinpoint it.
- **Sleight of Hand Check (DC 18)**: Try to subtly influence a dice roll (if she's feeling risky). Success: Wins the round. Failure: Caught cheating—consequences vary (could be a fight, could be ejected, could be a "teach me" moment).
- **Insight Check (DC 14)**: Read the room and identify who has money, who's desperate, who's a mark. Success: Quinn can target the right game/player. Failure: She misreads someone and gets into an awkward situation.

**Potential Rewards:**
- A significant coin win (or loss, depending on rolls)
- Information about a nearby town with a tavern for sale
- A connection to a gambling network that could help her future tavern dreams

### **Ra** - The Shadow Agent

**What They'd Enjoy:**
- **The Whisper Network**: A corner table where information brokers and shady characters exchange news. Ra could gather intel or make contacts.
- **The Poison Taster's Challenge**: A local alchemist is testing new antidotes and needs someone to sample "harmless" toxins (with antidotes ready). High risk, high reward.
- **The Hidden Stash**: Ra notices a loose floorboard near the bar. Could contain contraband, secrets, or just old coins.

**RP Opportunities:**
- **Stealth Check (DC 15)**: Investigate the loose floorboard without being noticed. Success: Finds a hidden compartment with old documents or a small cache. Failure: The tavern keeper notices and confronts them (could turn into a negotiation).
- **Deception Check (DC 13)**: Blend into the whisper network and gather information. Success: Learns about a shipment of rare poisons coming through, or information about the Gloaming Court. Failure: Someone recognizes them (or their methods) and becomes suspicious.
- **Investigation Check (DC 14)**: Examine the poison taster's setup for authenticity. Success: Determines if it's safe or a scam. Failure: Can't tell, must rely on other methods.

**Potential Rewards:**

### **Cala** - The Mischievous Rat-Fey

**What He'd Enjoy:**
- **The Sweet Treats**: The tavern has a selection of honey cakes, sugared nuts, and a special "Feywild Fizz" drink that's overly sweet. Cala's eyes would light up.
- **The Hidden Nooks**: Small spaces under tables, behind barrels, in rafters—perfect for a 2-foot-tall creature to nest and observe.
- **The Chewing Contest**: Locals are betting on who can chew through the toughest leather strap the fastest. Cala's rat heritage gives him an edge.

**RP Opportunities:**
- **Acrobatics Check (DC 12)**: Climb into the rafters unnoticed to observe and nest. Success: Cala finds a perfect spot and overhears interesting conversations. Failure: Someone notices and either finds it amusing or tries to shoo him down.
- **Persuasion Check (DC 11)**: Convince the tavern keeper to give him extra sweet treats (maybe in exchange for a small service). Success: Gets a stash of honey cakes. Failure: The keeper is amused but firm—standard portions only.
- **Stealth Check (DC 13)**: Hide in a shadowy corner and observe the room, looking for mischief opportunities or interesting items. Success: Spots something valuable or overhears a secret. Failure: Someone notices him and either engages or shoos him away.

**Potential Rewards:**

- Information overheard from the rafters
- A small trinket or coin found in a hidden spot
- A new "nesting spot" location for future use
