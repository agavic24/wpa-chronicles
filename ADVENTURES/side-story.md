Outside of the Salty Pig, a small group gathers.  Marz and Quinn stand together as Ra’vek waits by the door for Aillig to come out.

The warm spring evening glows with the waxing moon and countless stars above.

The air carries the rich, loamy smell of freshly turned earth from the surrounding fields, mixed with the sweet perfume of night-blooming jasmine growing wild along the tavern’s walls.

The sounds of the outpost settling into night surround you - the distant bells of cattle clanging, the rhythmic chirping of crickets in the fields beyond, and the muffled laughter and clink of tankards filter through the tavern door. Somewhere down the dirt road, a dog barks twice, then falls silent.
```

```
“Alight.  We’re outside.”

Ra remarks as he looks at Marz.

“What’s this all about?  And where are you going?”
```

```
Marz gives Quinn a look.

“Like I said, let’s walk and talk.  We headed this way.”

Marz gestures down the dirt street to the north.

After passing by a few closed shops and putting some distance between you and the tavern, he turns to the group.

“Ok - so as Quinn mentioned.  We’re tracking down someone… an old friend. He may be here and… well…”

Marz looks around, ensuring no preying ears or eyes are tracking them.

“Well, our friend was kidnapped.  And we got to get him back!”
```

```
Aillig: "That's quite an assertion. Why do you belive your friend to have been kidnapped?" 
```

```
Quinn knew she should trust Aillig, and Ra, but she hesitates to immediately offer a detailed explanation. Especially after Marz was so quick to bring their conversation outside. Was it wise to bring more than the two of them on this mission, even just to check out a tip? Taking in a breath, she opens her palm where one single die lay, and rolls it into her other hand.

She stares at the die for a moment, then two, before she returns it to her other hand, where she proceeds to fiddle it once again. Her ears are scanning their surroundings carefully as she speaks quietly. "Two years ago, Marz and I had a tortle friend. He was an amazing singer with a beautiful voice. We were all close...but I guess someone found out how lucrative his voice really was. He was taken when Marz and I were away from his side." Her whiskers pulled back with her ears. "There was no trace of him, and no reason for him to leave so suddenly. Marz was the one who found traces of him eventually, and tracked him here."
```

```
Aillig slowly nods. "My work occasionally involved tracking down things that had been... lets say, 'made to go missing.' Usually an object, but unfortunately certain groups in Sigil sometimes consider certain types of peoples to just be a unique form of valuable object." He shrugs a shoulder "A friend of a friend is a friend as they say. Allow us to help in any way that we can."
```

```“Mmph. That must be some voice.” remarks, Ra dryly.

He then turns to Marz. “And you … you tracked him here to this outpost? What’s your plan? As Aillig said, we'll try to help.”
```

```
Marz is clearly not happy with Ra’s skepticism. He snaps back.

“Yes. His singing was… IS very unique.”

And then his face twists slightly as some old memory comes to mind.
“Quinn. I forgot to tell you.  Do you remember the night we met Makolo back in Jexara?  Well… my first clues led me to those thugs that tried to mug him. They didn't like how we interred.”

You can see Marz’s teeth clench for a moment.
“Turns out they owed some coin to a crime lord who liked collecting curiosities - exotic creatures, rare talents, anything that would amuse or impress.  They were the ones who initially kidnapped Makolo and bartered him into slavery to pay off their debt…”

His head lowers.
“By the time I got close to that crime lord, our friend Makolo had already been sold off.”
He now turns back to Ra’vek.
“I’ve been following Makolo’s trail ever since.”

He straightens up.
“Three months back someone paid for a 'singing tortle' to be kept comfortable and brought here... to NLP.  That’s our friend, Makolo, for sure.”

He waves his hand around in no particular direction.
“And I got a tip that someone HERE knows about most of the exotic merchandise the moves through the grey market.”

He pauses for a moment while looking back to Quinn… and then decides to continue.
“Did you see that goblin lady at the bar? And the dwarf at the table?  They seem together …. and she at least knows something.”

You see him instinctually wrap a hand around his coin purse.
“The plan is to talk with her… everyone has a price.”

He then looks around at the group.
“Anyone know where the graveyard is? She gave me a hint that's where she'll be.”
```

```
Nodding, Aillig adds, "I've done my share of research and investigation. While we walk tell us everything you have discovered, maybe we can see a pattern in it that you have not yet discovered."
```

```
The location and clue together only made sense. She gives a nod. "Seems a good clue as any... I agree with Aillig too. Sharing what you know would be useful." Especially considering she was still keeping an eye on Marz in general.

*Marz takes a deep breath, his eyes scanning the darkening street ahead as he begins to recount his long journey.*

**"It started in Jexara, where Quinn and I first met Makolo. Those thug arse-holes sold Makolo to a mid-tier slave trader outside of town - Captain Vex "Silk Fingers" Thorne.  She brought him aboard her ship, the Velvet Chain, and then sold him within a week for some quick coin."**

*He continues as you walk out of the old town and into the newer, surrounding and walled in village.*

**"It took me months to figure out where he went after that. Eventually I found out a wealthy barron had him. A Lord Castellan Mondro... Mordrew.  Something like that. Crazy wealthy, that one. He'd collected rare art, wine, and entertainment... all just to flaunt his wealth and power to other arses. I never got close to that guy, but I did learn where Makolo was eventually sold off for some deep stacks of coin."**

*Marz's hands clench slightly as he continues. The outpost flows by and you notice the governors keep off in the distance.*

**"Then there was the crossing of the Forgotten Sea... CRIKEY! We ran right into the worst storm I'd ever seen. Waves taller than the ship's masts. I swore I would die that night. Two men fell overboard. Somehow we made it out... and that's where I met, Cedric. I saved his life that night."**

*Marz shakes his head, forcing himself to continue. The aetheryte is off to the south, but Marz missed it.*

**"Then it was south to Port Veridian and Port Sable and eventually to the west. So few every saw Makolo... he was always kept in nicer quarters and away from prying eyes. I met two servants that had seen him... or at least talked... and they said he was in good health..  was at least 4... 5 months ago."**

*His eyes darken with a memory... or saddness... hard to say. *

**"Anyway... I eventually ended up in a port city called *Tide's End*. That was three months ago.  I was out with a friend and we were... ah, keeping company with... some... new friends. And they were telling us of this big heist that went down the prior month with one of their wealthier... customers. It didn't take long for me to realize they were talking about our friend, Makolo. Apparently he had been stolen from this guy's estate in the middle of the night!"**

*Marz's voice drops lower, more urgent. You're now walking past the sturdy stone walls and elevated watchtowers of the outpost and into the first few farm fields.*

**"A few more port stops and few more bribes later, I was headed on another long sail... this time with Cedric in tow. We arrived in the City of Lights last week. A dockhand confirmed that they'd seen only one tortle this season and he even described an orange birthmark on the throat - Makolo was here on Northern Lights Province. No one knew exactly where he went, but whoever he was with had bought cold weather gear. We also learned that almost all trade routes flow through this outpost and that there was someone here running a grey market."**

*He pauses. Up ahead you can see a the glow of a few lanterns near a large complex on the left.  On the right side faint shadows flicker off headstones that peak above the low stone fencing.*

**"So ya.. we soon hired Mina... and now... we're here."**

*He looks to each of you.*

**"Ah... what's the plan, Quinn? You know this group better than anyone."**
