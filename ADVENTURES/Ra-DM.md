## Scene: Tavern Conversation - Quinn asks about Kly

**Setting:** A tavern, Ra and party members sitting around a table. Quinn asks about Kly.

---

**Quinn:** "So, Ra... what's the deal with Kly? How'd he come to following you around?"

*Ra pauses, taking a slow sip of their drink. They glance around the table, considering how much to share. The party has proven trustworthy, but some things are better left in shadows.*

**Ra:** "Kly? He's... a gift, I suppose. From my patron."

*Ra's tone is measured, careful. They set their drink down and lean back slightly.*

**Ra:** "When I first made my pact, I was... learning. My patron thought I could use someone to watch my back. Someone who could go places I couldn't, see things I might miss."

*They pause again, a flicker of something unreadable crossing their face—perhaps memory, perhaps something darker.*

**Ra:** "Kly was bound to me then. Over time, I learned to call on him myself. He's useful. Loyal, in his own way."

Quinn listens carefully, drinking more ale as she does. She supposes it makes sense, even if the response is a bit guarded. "So he's not bound to you anymore?"
