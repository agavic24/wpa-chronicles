    ## Finnick (Finn) Blackam
    Dwarf Cobbler (duergar wearing necklace of disguise to appear dwarf). Also hosts the grey market for Verdant (a stand-in for thieves guild-style activity). They and their crew keep brigands from targeting the outpost but provide a relay for questionable goods ( stolen, contraband luxuries, and the occasional "exotic curiosity" or magic item)

    ## Banya Blackam
    Cobbler’s goblin wife, local midwife (Ma’ba nickname for Mama Banya). Given her trade she has her ear to the ground and knows about everyone's business in the outpost.


    ## Viktor Mazan, the Lycan Lord
    A Neutral Good werewolf lord who rules over Shatterstone in Brokenstone Vale, Viktor Mazan aids his fellow werewolves and other lycans in the Feywilds eke out a peaceful existence after a years long war. Viktor does not allow travelers to remain long and sends them off again as quickly as possible. Not everyone wants Mazan’s new civilization, and rumors have begun to circulate that factions in the upper mountains plot to destroy the werewolf lord and resume the war against the fey once more.
    
    ## Lord Calenon Thray
    Ruler of Shinaelestra, the Fading City, a city located in the Feywild. He's an eladrin ranger, some who claim to be the greatest ranger to ever live.

    ## Maiden of the Moon
    An archfey patron of Ra who struck a bargin with them one fateful night and made a pact that resulted in Ra's warlock powers.  She is also a formidable hunter who carries a silver sword said to be able to cut through nightmares. The lycanthropes of Brokenstone Vale are suspected to be under the protection of the *Maiden of the Moon*. The magic that permeates the vale that allows them to control their transformation, a blessing from her.  Her silver sword is the doom of any werebeast that crosses her path outside the Brokenstone Vale.  While the Maiden of the Moon wages a private war against evil lycanthropes and other savage killers, she is considered benevolent toward mortals. Although she has many hunting camps in the Feywild, one in particular is a portal to her own private sanctuary on the shining moon above.

    ## The Gloaming Court
    This is not a single individual, but an entire Feywild court of archfey sometimes referred to as the Unseelie Court or the Winter Court.  They control the Land of Winter and are led by Queen Mab (aka the Queen of Air and Darkness or the Winter Queen), who is the sister of Titania, the Queen of the Summer Court.  There is no current King of the Winter Court. There are two Princesses in the Winter Court; Maeve (the Maiden of the Moon) and Auril (the Frostmaiden).  Many are associated with dreams, darkness, stars, twilight, dusk, and other such nocturnal phenomena that manifest more abstract qualities than seasons or living nature. Although equal in power to the other courts, these archfey keep their own counsel. Members are often seen as rejecting civilization and traditional norms. Many have embarced shadow magic, a power emanating from the Shadowfell that is the root of necromancy and nethermancy, and which typically has a powerful morally corruptive effect on its practitioners.  As a result, Unseelie fey tend to be mutated and malevolent.  They are composed of a loose league, rather than a proper faction, but when the Court of Stars is in session, they band together during court intrigues. The most well known of the Gloaming Fey is the **Maiden of the Moon**.

    ## Lumenbound
    A secretive group of agents bound to the Gloaming Court in the Feywild

    ## Feligrin
    Fox in the swamp. Romantically interested in Quinn.

    ## Krip-Krip
    Friend of the party. Despite a dispute with Klymok, he eventually took a liking to the Imp.
    
    ## Oona
    Oona's journal spoke of someone she missed everyday, that was her brother Kaelen Moonshadow.

    ## Sporion
    
    ## Marz 
    A sharp-tongued goblin who befriended Quinn and Makolo many years ago.  He's been building a network of contacts and has a knack for uncovering secrets.  He's looking for Makolo (who was abducted) with an obsession to rescue him.  He can be defensive, quick to justify himself, but his words falter when vulnerable. Guilt-ridden — apologizes for not preventing what happened to Makolo. Loyal and determined — years of searching, driven to find Makolo despite the cost, can't stop now that he's close. He's probably neglected himself, relationships, and other opportunities in this noble, yet self-destructive cause.  He's a bit paranoid and cautious — checks for watchers constantly after years of following dangerous leads. His personality: When things get bleak, he deflects with a joke or clever wordplay. It's both endearing and tragic, showing how he pushes through despair.  His quest is as much about self-forgiveness as it is about rescuing his friend.

    ## Makolo Tidewalker
    A light-hearted, singing tortle whos deep, resonant, and strange voice captivated sailors and brought good coin in bustling ports. One evening, while busking in the alleyways of Jexara Landing, a crooked port town, two thugs cornered him while he walked home with his night’s earnings.  Quinn and Marz saved him that night and they became fast friends. They were an odd trio, but survival forged strong bonds. Quinn knew the alleys. Marz knew the angles. Makolo brought calm, music, and stories they never imagined were real. Together, they scraped by - laughing, scheming, sharing languages, and dreaming of something bigger than the streets. The two thugs (Darrik and Lugg), humiliated and bitter, resurfaced a year later with darker intent. They’d caught wind of a crime lord known for collecting curiosities - exotic creatures, rare talents, anything that would amuse or impress. The thugs were in need of coin and remembered Makolo: the strange singing tortle with the mesmerizing voice. One quiet night, while Quinn and Marz were away playing dice, the thugs struck. No dramatic fight, no chance to resist. Just a sack over the head, a heavy club, and a quick deal made in the dark. Makolo was gone before dawn - sold into slavery, never to have been seen again.  Makolo's singing has a special ability; it essentially evokes Healing Sound (like Healing Light from https://www.worldanvil.com/block/803158) that heals those around him from minor injuries. He is currently with *Boss Hog* aboard his flagship patrolling the west coast of NLP. Makolo is kept in *Boss Hog's* quarters under constant guard, possibly chained, and only brought outside when healing injured pirates.

    ## Boss Hog 
    A huge 10' tall, nasty pig-faced boarfolk with large tusks that protrude from his mouth. Pirate and all around chaos maker.  Brother to *Iron Tusk*. https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/monsters-by-type/humanoids/boarfolk/

    ## Iron Tusk
    Captain of The Tidecaller Syndicate - a maritime piracy operation.  He lost one tusk during battle and somehow hired/forced someone to magically enfused an iron tusk in it's place - some say the tusk more than just iron. *Iron Tusk* is the older and more disciplined brother to *Boss Hog*. He is the one who plans an ambush while his younger brother enjoys the chaos and carnage. Since *Makolo* was acquired, *Iron Tusk* has on more dangerous targets and sustain longer campaigns.  He has a growing reputation among pirates and merchants alike.

    # Finnick (Finn) Blackam 
    Dwarf Cobbler (duergar wearing necklace of disguise to appear dwarf). His goblin wife, Banya Blackam, is a local midwife (Ma'ba nickname for Mama Banya).  Has three HobGoblin daughters Sida, Gida, and Pelora.
    They run a Cobbler shop by the graveyard, but it also hosts the grey market for Verdant (a stand-in for thieves guild-style activity). They and their crew keep brigands from targeting the outpost and provide a relay for questionable goods.

    ## Saelathria Moonshadow
    Long ago a clever, silver-scaled dragon touched by Feywild magic created a fey crossing and fled into the Feywild to secure her clutch from hunters in the mortal realm. The energies of the Feywild changed her descendants, turning them into moonstone dragons: ethereal, shimmering creatures who dwell between moonbeams, dreams, and tree-shadows. Knowing that even the Feywild held dangers, Saelathria sought allies. She forged a Guardianship Pact with a lineage of fey warriors who lived near the crossing. These guardians would help conceal and protect the crossing and act as intermediaries, performing duties the dragons could not without revealing the site. This pact was built on respect, service, and secrecy—never servitude.  Lethanyra Delhin is the current guardian.

    # Velisar Moonrock
    A younger moonstone dragon that has taken a personal interest in Mina.

    ## Lethanyra Delhin
    Mina's mother is no noble of the Feywild, but a respected worker and groundskeeper in the court of a minor fey noble. What she lacks in political standing, she makes up for in diligence, subtle wisdom, and a reputation for getting things done discreetly. Lethanyra is one of the very few mortals or demi-fey who know the moonstone dragons exist. She inherited a pact with the moonstone dragons after her own parents passed. She has honored the pact faithfully, maintaining the redwood fairy circle, passing messages for the dragons, and performing the rituals that keep the crossing masked from all but its rightful observers. When she had Mina—half stone-giant, half fey—she knew at once that her daughter would one day be the next guardian. Mina’s immense potential made Lethanyra both hopeful and terrified.

    ## Silisk Delhin
    Mina's father. Went on a dream quest which led him to the Feywild. He fell in love with Mina's mother quickly.  But Silisk eventually got lost, believing that he was living in an actual dream and that their actions have no real consequences.  He's becoming a force of chaos and a risk to the moonstone dragons as he's slowly descending towards being a dream walker.

    ## Vaelith Duskrune
    Exiled Keeper of the Ley Lines. 
    Race: Female Wood Elf
    Class: Druid (Circle of Wildfire, previously Circle of the Moon)
    Alignment: Neutral
    Age: Over 400 years
    Location: The Veil of Shadows, Underdark
    Lover of Oona’s Brother: Kaelen Moonshadow
    Background: When Kaelen died, she proposed to use shadow magic.  The druid circle disagreed; they were going to try and use a seed from the Tree of Souls instead. Eventually she was exiled for her beliefs in fear that she would disrupt the ritual.

    ## Bramble "Bram" Mossrunner
    Cala's father. A ratkin lycan and a guide who helped folks with safe passage across the Brokenstone Vale.  Went into hiding from the Maiden of the Moon, after giving up the location of her patrol party and she has a bounty on his head.  Was blackmailed by King Bronnor's minions after they kidnapped his son, Cala.

    ## Thrumbolg
    Lord of Mag Tureah, 

    ## King Bronnor
    Ruler of Harrowhame, Plots to ambush and slay the Maiden of the Moon. Kidnapped Cala and blackmailed his father, Bram. Cala was deemed too small and useless as a slave and was transferred to Mug Tureah as a potential test subject for many planar portals in the tunnels.  Holds 3 members on the Maiden of the Moon's border patrol as prisoners.

    ## The Queen of Nightmare Fairies
    A relatively insignificant Archfey in the court of the Unseelie Fey. The queen acquired Skjolna for Thrumbolg and cursed her into becoming the Bheur Hag, Mother Snæbjörg. Here agreement with Thrumbolg is that she will provide Fomorians access to a stable Fey Gate near an entrance to the Feydark, which they can use to mount their kidnapping raids into the Underdark, in exchange for protection for her agents, a race of corrupted pixies, who will travel with them. The Queen's corrupted pixies infest mortal beings with terrifying dreams using Nightmare Toxin, a hallucinogenic poison, which expends psychic energy that the pixies collect and bring back to the Queen for her personal feasting.


    ## Mother Snæbjörg
    Centuries ago, before she became a hag, she was a druid on the material plane named Skjolna. Thrumbolg, First Lord of the Fomorians and King of Mag Tureah, acquired Skjolna with the help of The Queen of Nightmares, and her fairies and feygate. The queen cursed Skjolna into becoming the Bheur Hag, Mother Snæbjörg. For centuries, Mother Snæbjörg was a broker of “subjects” to the Fomorians and other cruel denizens of the Underdark and Feywild. She served Mug Tureah and Harrowhame’s twisted rulers and specialized in “softening” captives. She would take souls, children, and creatures brought by The Queen of Nightmares and then break their will, steal their memories, and prepare them as vessels for magical planar experiments. Her full, vast, horrifying collection—dozens or hundreds of broken memories and stolen souls—is hidden deeper in the Feywild, in a secret “cold nursery” inside in Mug Tureah.
