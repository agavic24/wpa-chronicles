    ## Saelathria Moonshadow
    Long ago a clever, silver-scaled dragon touched by Feywild magic created a fey crossing and fled into the Feywild to secure her clutch from hunters in the mortal realm. The energies of the Feywild changed her descendants, turning them into moondragons: ethereal, shimmering creatures who dwell between moonbeams, dreams, and tree-shadows. Knowing that even the Feywild held dangers, Saelathria sought allies. She forged a Guardianship Pact with a lineage of half-fey warriors who lived near the redwood circles. These guardians would help conceal and protect the crossing and act as intermediaries, performing duties the dragons could not without revealing the site. This pact was built on respect, service, and secrecy—never servitude.  Lethanyra is the current guardian.

    ## Lethanyra Delhin
    Mina's mother is no noble of the Feywild, but a respected worker and groundskeeper in the court of a minor fey noble. What she lacks in political standing, she makes up for in diligence, subtle wisdom, and a reputation for getting things done discreetly. Lethanyra is one of the very few mortals or demi-fey who know the moondragons exist. She inherited a pact with the moondragons after her own parents passed. She has honored the pact faithfully, maintaining the redwood fairy circle, passing messages for the dragons, and performing the rituals that keep the crossing masked from all but its rightful observers. When she had Mina—half stone-giant, half fey—she knew at once that her daughter would one day be the next guardian. Mina’s immense potential made Lethanyra both hopeful and terrified.

    ## Vaelith Duskrune
    Exiled Keeper of the Ley Lines. 
    Race: Female Wood Elf

    Location: The Veil of Shadows, Underdark
    Lover of Oona’s Brother: Kaelen Moonshadow

    ## Thrumbolg
    Lord of Mag Tureah, 

    ## King Bronnor
    Ruler of Harrowhame, Plots to ambush and slay the Maiden of the Moon.

    ## The Queen of Nightmare Fairies
    A relatively insignificant Archfey in the court of the Unseelie Fey. The queen acquired Skjolna for Thrumbolg and cursed her into 
    becoming the Bheur Hag, Mother Snæbjörg. Here agreement with Thrumbolg is that she will provide Fomorians access to a stable Fey Gate near an entrance to the Feydark, which they can use to mount their kidnapping raids into the Underdark, in exchange for protection for her agents, a race of corrupted pixies, who will travel with them. The Queen's corrupted pixies infest mortal beings with terrifying dreams using Nightmare Toxin, a hallucinogenic poison, which expends psychic energy that the pixies collect and bring back to the Queen for her personal feasting.
