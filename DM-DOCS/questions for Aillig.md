Open questions Ra might ask Aillig

Tell me the story of how you became a sigil agent — what drew you into that work, and what did you have to give up to do it?
You mentioned a mentor who reached you in a swamp — who were they and what did they teach you that still matters?
What exactly do you mean when you talk about “the cube” and “the seed”? Why do they nag at you?
Walk me through that dream where you were taken apart and put back together. What sensations or images stuck with you?
How do you think that dream changed you — practically, emotionally, or in your work?
You fold paper and then things appear — how does your Tinker’s Magic look and feel when you use it? Do you know any limits or triggers?
What would you need to make that temporary-magic trick permanent? Have you tried?
Tell me about your experimental elixirs: what’s the method, what risks do they carry, and which one scares or excites you most?
Who is Merriwig Fiddlecap to you — ally, rival, or lab partner? How did you two meet?
You keep a Lockbox of Holding. What’s inside that you won’t tell anyone, and why is it important enough to lock away?
What’s the plan for the Magical Ability Tattoo Needle? What do you need, and what happens if it goes wrong?
That “creepy still-beating heart in a jar” — where did it come from and what does it do?
You carry a Skyblinder Staff and a Spell-Refueling Ring — how do you use them in the field, and are there quirks I should know about?
Which languages and tools do you use most on a job, and why those — is there a story behind any of them?
How do you enforce contracts? Give me an example of a clause you wrote that changed the outcome of a dispute.
When you say you believe in “proper forms and symbols,” can you show me a sigil or ritual and explain what it binds?
Have you ever been forced to break a contract? What happened, and how did it change your rules?
What do you want from power now that your old life as a sigil agent is over — what would a new purpose look like?
Which of your spells or artificer features do you lean on in a tight spot, and how do you combine them with your tools?
Tell me about the items you can’t replace or won’t part with — why are they sacred to you?
Is there anyone or any group who would come after you for the plans inside your box or the needle design?
You hinted at a message that vanishes at dawn about your Tinker’s Magic — who would leave such a thing, and what would you hope it says?
If you had to pick one fear about your future, what is it? If you had to pick one hope, what is that?
What would you ask me for if I offered to help with your tattoos, your elixirs, or tracking down the seed?
