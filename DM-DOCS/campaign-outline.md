# Campaign Outline

## Overall Goal of Campaign
Restoring Balance.  It's not just about removing corruption, but 

## Overview
An evil green dragon, Venom, settled into the southern side of the island, drawn to the powerful ley lines there.
Venom’s magic started tainting the ley lines as it tapped into their power.
Battles between Venom's minions and druidic elves ensued, but the elves lost.
A plague spread across the south, corrupting the lands and creating abominations and a deadly swamp.
To restore balance, they must uncover the origins of the corruption, find a way to purify the ley lines, and ultimately defeat Venom, the ancient green dragon who orchestrated this devastation.
This journey will take them across distant lands, from the heights of Isanya’s Spire to the depths of the Underdark, before returning to the corrupted swamp for the final battle.

## Campaign Arc

## Part 0: Setting the Stage
An unlikely troop of characters bond together as they explore an island continent, the Norther Lights Providence.
Within the swamp of Snakewood the party will see Saba depart the party, but make a new friend in Feligrinn.
They will battle Oona the Lost and the Sporion that corrupted her.
They know not what the Sporion exactly is or what to do with its heart they collected, so the journey begins seeking knowledge on how to unwind the corruption.
Mina will depart at this point.

## Part 1: Seeking Knowledge
The party will seek out Edrik Fenwyn, a historian living in the Crimson Grove, who is their best lead on what the Sporion and the corruption could be.
Edrik provides some answers into personal backstories and suggests they find Vaelith Duskrune, an elf likely to understand the corruption's true nature.
Along the way, the party gets caught up with a bheur hag, Mother Snæbjörg, who's been corrupting the mountainous region of Isanya's Spine.
As it turns out, she was behind Cala's kidnapping and loss of memory; clues are left for a future exploration of the Feywild and Feydark.
The party will eventually defeat Snæbjörg and arrive at the Verdant Outpost.  Here they will be reunited with Mina and meet one of Quinn's old acquaintances, Marz. 
Merriwig Fiddlecap's in the Mushroom Forest, only to find out that Vaelith was rumored to have left for the Underdark.  
The journey will continue under ground.

Part 2: Navigating Darkness
Deep beneath the surface lies the Underdark.
Szinth’alyra, or The Vault, is an ancient Drow city hidden in the vast tunnels of the Underdark. 
The party must seek out Vaelith Duskrune there and obtain her knowledge of ley lines and corruption.
Vaelith will explain that the dragon’s magic which corrupted the ley lines has started a rot is spreading on its own now.  If something could be made to consume the corruption in the ley lines, just as the mushrooms consumed rot, it could be undone from within.

Challenge: Gaining entry into the surface is perilous — Drow society is highly secretive, and the party must either sneak in, earn an invitation, or strike a dangerous bargain with an Underdark faction.
Key NPC: Vaelith Duskrune, an exiled Drow druid and scholar, once a protector of the ley lines but now hunted for defying the Matron Mothers. She agrees to help if the party can eliminate a Mind Flayer cult that seeks to enslave the region.
Discovery: Through her studies, Vaelith reveals that the corruption is tied directly to Venom’s heart, which he bound to the ley lines using a long-lost artifact—the Verdant Core—now hidden in a sunken elven vault.

# Part 2: Recovering the Verdant Core
Location: The Sunken Vault
Once an elven sanctuary, this temple was swallowed by the ocean when the ley lines were twisted. It is now submerged beneath treacherous waters, guarded by restless spirits and sea creatures.
Challenge: Navigating the ruins requires magical means or an alliance with the local merfolk, who view outsiders with suspicion.
Key NPC: Queen Nylith of the Tideborn, ruler of the merfolk, offers aid in exchange for dealing with a monstrous abomination lurking within the ruins.
Discovery: The Verdant Core is protected by a trial—visions of the past reveal the elves’ desperate battle against Venom and the moment the ley lines were corrupted.

# Part 3: The Dragon’s Wrath
Location: The Swamp, Venom’s Awakening
With the Verdant Core in their possession, the party returns to the swamp to cleanse the ley lines. However, the moment they attempt to activate the artifact, Venom senses the disruption and launches a full-scale attack.
Battle Setup: The swamp itself fights alongside Venom—animated vines, toxic mists, and corrupted beasts strike as the dragon unleashes his fury.
- Phase 1: Venom uses hit-and-run tactics, poisoning the air and attacking from the shadows.
- Phase 2: As the party weakens him, he collapses sections of the swamp to isolate them and force a final confrontation in his lair.
- Climax: With Venom defeated, his influence over the ley lines is severed, but the land is still scarred.

# Part 4: The Final Restoration
Location: The Elven Homeland, The Tree of Life
The elves, now aware of Venom’s defeat, reveal the existence of a second Seed. This sacred relic, a direct offshoot of the legendary Tree of Life, has the power to restore the swamp’s balance.
Challenge: The Tree of Life is located deep within an enchanted forest, protected by ancient guardians. The party must prove themselves worthy.

Key NPC: Elder Lytheris, a weary but hopeful druid who reveals that planting the Seed will begin the land’s slow healing, but it will take centuries to fully recover.
Final Choice: The party may choose to leave behind a piece of themselves—a sacrifice of magic, vitality, or an oath—to ensure the land’s renewal.

# Conclusion: A New Dawn
With the Seed planted, the first signs of life return to the swamp. The ley lines begin to pulse with their natural energy, and nature starts to reclaim what was lost. The elves return to the land, ready to guide its slow rebirth.
Lasting Impact: The party’s names will be etched into legend, and future generations will speak of their deeds in restoring balance.
Unresolved Threads: Though Venom is slain, whispers tell of another force that once sought to control the ley lines. Did the dragon act alone, or was he merely a pawn in a grander scheme?
